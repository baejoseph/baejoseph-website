In a dimly lit room, three men stood, each a vivid representation of a distinct ideology. The first, a stoic and dignified figure, embodied the values of Christianity, conservatism, right-wing politics, nationalism, and a firm commitment to the rule of law. He radiated an aura of tradition and stability.

Facing him was a proponent of libertarian ideals—an unwavering advocate for personal freedom and minimal governmental intervention. His calm demeanour was the epitome of a philosophy that prioritised individual autonomy.

Contrasting sharply with them, the third man was an eclectic mix of various collectivist ideologies. He stood as an emblem of Communism, socialism, the Woke movement, political correctness, and globalism. Draped in a flamboyant, rainbow cape and sporting a distinctively androgynous fashion, his appearance bordered on the absurd, challenging any semblance of seriousness.

Central to the room was a sword, its blade catching the sparse light. Engraved along its length was the word "POWER"—a stark symbol of the immense authority and state power it represented.

The libertarian, with a tone of deliberate reason, addressed the Christian conservative. "If you vow never to wield that sword, I too shall refrain," he offered, proposing a pact grounded in mutual restraint and respect for their respective beliefs.

The Christian, understanding the weight of this commitment to non-aggression, nodded in solemn agreement. As they delved into a profound discussion, laying out their accord, they were unaware of the subtle, yet deliberate movements of the third man.

Initially, he moved with careful, understated steps, evading the attention of the other two. Then, in a moment of unexpected ferocity, he lunged for the sword. Gripping it with a resolve fuelled by his ideology, he turned it into a lethal instrument of his beliefs. With a swift, merciless stroke, he struck down both the Christian and the libertarian. This brutal act was a chilling embodiment of the overpowering and ruthless nature of collectivist totalitarianism.

This is the story of the modern West. The Christian and the libertarian shake hands on a gentleman's agreement to keep state power off the table—because that's what principled people do. Meanwhile, the left has never once played by those rules. They never intended to.

The naïveté of the right is almost theological in its stubbornness: the belief that if we simply refuse to play power games, the other side will follow suit. They won't. They never have. History is unambiguous on this point.

The sword doesn't disappear because you agree not to touch it. It waits. And the person willing to grab it—without hesitation, without apology—will determine what the room looks like when the lights come on.

I'm not arguing for ruthlessness. I'm arguing for clarity. Know what you're dealing with. Name it accurately. And stop being surprised when people who have declared their intentions carry them out.
