The wolf in sheep’s clothing is not a metaphor. It is the Prime Minister.

Keir Starmer is a Fabian. Not a rumour, not right-wing paranoia—the Fabian Society itself boasts of it. Every Labour Prime Minister has been one of theirs. The Foreign Secretary David Lammy, Fabian. The Health Secretary Wes Streeting, Fabian. The Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson, Fabian. The Leader of the House Lucy Powell, Fabian. Justin Madders rose in Parliament on 5 December 2024 and declared on the record: “When the Fabian Society, of which I declare I am a member…” (Hansard). The rot runs through the entire Cabinet, top to bottom.

And still people call it incompetence.

### The Society That Changed Britain Forever

The Fabian Society was founded in 1884—not to argue for socialism in the open, but to achieve it through stealth. Their motto: “the inevitability of gradualness.” Their original emblem: a wolf in sheep’s clothing. They later changed it to a tortoise. Slow and steady. Patient. Generational.

Their aims were identical to those of Marx and Lenin—collective state power, the abolition of private wealth, the destruction of the independent family, church and community. The difference was method. The Fabians looked at the English working class and concluded, correctly, that they would never revolt. So instead of storming the barricades, they infiltrated the universities, the civil service, the press, the schools, the church. They captured the institutions from within.

HG Wells was briefly one of them. He left after disagreements—and George Bernard Shaw, in the famous Fabian Window now hanging at the London School of Economics, depicted Wells as a fool. The Fabians do not forgive apostasy. By 1918, William Bullitt was already using the phrase “new world order” in correspondence with Woodrow Wilson. By 1919, a Progressive Baptist minister named Samuel Zane Batten had published *The New World Order*, proposing world socialism under the banner of the social gospel—Fabian ideas dressed in Christian clothing. By 1940, Wells himself published his own *The New World Order*, calling for technocratic, scientifically planned socialist world government.

The language changes. The project does not.

### They Told Us What They Were

This is what makes me most angry. They were never entirely secret. The wolf in sheep’s clothing was their *logo*. They said it plainly enough—gradual, patient, institutional capture. George Bernard Shaw, one of the founding Fabians, was explicit about the goal. Yet generation after generation, Britain looked away. We preferred to think of these people as harmless eccentrics debating socialism in Bloomsbury drawing rooms.

We were not paying attention. And [the mainstream media wasn’t going to tell us](/sober/).

Jesus warned us: “Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves” (Matthew 7:15). The warning is not merely spiritual. It is political. It is sociological. Wolves do not announce themselves. That is the entire point.

### The Eight-Pronged Dismantling

What has 140 years of Fabian infiltration produced? Look at Britain in 2025 and count:

**Borders destroyed.** Mass immigration at a scale that overwhelms housing, schools and the NHS. This is not compassion—it is the deliberate erasure of national identity, the depression of wages, and the manufacture of social fragmentation. Divided people are easier to rule.

**Families attacked.** The tax system punishes marriage. Welfare rewards fatherlessness. Schools undermine parental authority at every turn. The Fabians understood early: strong families mean weak states. So the family must be weakened.

**Faith and tradition erased.** [Christian heritage](/recon/) is mocked as colonialism. History is rewritten as a litany of shame. People rooted in faith and tradition are harder to manipulate—so they must be cut off from their roots. [This is the core of what I’ve called the Christian critique of the left](/leftism-eng/): leftism is not merely a political programme but a spiritual one, aimed at displacing God with the state.

**[Free speech](/aaron/) silenced.** Opinions are criminalised. People are jailed for words posted online. The Fabians don’t need a secret police when self-censorship does the work for them.

**Community destroyed.** Local councils stripped of power. Pubs, clubs and voluntary associations suffocated by regulation. People atomised and made dependent on central government. No mediating institutions. Only the individual and the state.

**Economy gutted.** Manufacturing sacrificed to finance. Farmers regulated out of viability. Net Zero strangling energy. The permanent debt trap ensuring that citizens can never accumulate enough wealth to resist.

**Health weaponised.** The NHS left to collapse—not through accident but through policy—and then offered back only in exchange for digital ID, lifestyle compliance and state control of the body.

**Education captured.** Schools and universities no longer teach children how to think. They teach them *what* to think. An indoctrinated generation cannot recognise the cage it inhabits.

None of this is accident. None of this is incompetence.

### The Endgame

They want a Britain where the state is the only authority. No family strong enough to resist. No community independent enough to be ignored. No wealth private enough to escape taxation. No speech free enough to challenge the narrative.

Everything channelled through government. Everything monitored. Everything rationed. Everything licensed.

This is not the dystopian fantasy of a conspiracy theorist. This is the stated programme of the Fabian Society, pursued with extraordinary patience across 140 years. The Britain of 2025 is not an accident—it is a destination.

[We are living through England’s long reckoning](/reckoning/). Psalm 101 is a psalm of the king who pledges to cut off the wicked from the city of the Lᴏʀᴅ. We are not there yet. The wicked are cutting off the righteous. But that cannot hold forever.

### The Wolf Is in Downing Street

Keir Starmer and his Cabinet are not bumbling administrators who stumbled into power. They are Fabians—ideologically formed, institutionally disciplined, historically aware of exactly what they are doing and why. They are carrying out a programme set in motion 140 years ago: undermine the nation’s fabric, weaken its people, centralise all power in the state.

This is not incompetence. This is not chance. This is Fabianism. A deliberate betrayal of the British people by people who have always despised them—their faith, their families, their freedoms, their flag.

The wolf was always there. We just refused to see it.

[The fight to take Britain back](/restore/) will not be won by a single election or a single man. It will be won by families who refuse to be atomised, by churches that refuse to be silenced, by men and women who are willing to name what is happening plainly and pay the cost of doing so. In Harpenden, as in every town across this island, that choice falls to ordinary people.

The first step is seeing clearly. Stop calling this incompetence.

Call it what it is.
