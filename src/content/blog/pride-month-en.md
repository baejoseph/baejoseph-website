> You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and be trampled by men.

> Matthew 5:13

Every month of June, madness descends upon the Western society. It is the celebration (yes, a celebration!) of all things sexually immoral and deviant. The rainbow flag is unilaterally imposed on pretty much everything everywhere, and everyone is expected to vocally express “their full support for LGBTQ colleagues and friends”. Everyone and their dog are busy virtue-signalling by flying the rainbow flag across the twitter-sphere and on every other social network on the interwebs. Not to be outdone, every large corporation tints their logos in the familiar rainbow colours for the whole duration of June like clockwork. It has become such a rite of passage, that it is no longer acceptable to even stay silent and shut up and do nothing; your conspicuous inaction will be noticed by the Zealots that are the LGBTQIA+ Allies, the HR department, the media, and the Big Tech. Step out of line, and their retaliation will be swift: first by shadow-banning and de-platforming, and then by punishment through disciplining and firing. All of this is reminiscent of 1930s Germany, when the swastika was forced upon the population.

This year, let us make the decision to no longer be silenced by the mob.

First, let’s get our definitions straight. What is love? Love is not unconditional tolerance. The Bible says that God is love; everything God does is by definition loving. In the beginning, God created the universe. God created human beings in his image. God created marriage to be between one man and one woman, and gave it to us for human flourishing. Sex is to be between a man and a woman in the context of marriage. God calls LGBTQ sin, and he calls to repentance all who partake in such activities.

Now, if you are a Christian, none of the points made in the above paragraph should be controversial. Sadly, however, I’m discovering that many Christians have grown so used to compromising with the world, and have become so emasculated by it, that they not only stay silent; they actively defend and promote such madness, and even throw their own brothers and sisters under the proverbial bus in an attempt to distance themselves from their position, in order to maintain their own good-standing with the Zealots. In short, they have (and I do not say this lightly) become salt that has lost its saltiness.

As Christians, we are called to speak the truth in love. We are called to call out sin for what it is, because that is the most loving thing you can do. Unconditional acceptance and affirmation is not only cowardly; it is deeply unloving and callous, when you know that the other person is headed for certain destruction. For God so loved the world, that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever repents and believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life.
