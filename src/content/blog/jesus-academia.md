From 23rd–27th December 2024, my whole family attended the **55th Class of Jesus Academia** in Long Island, NY. It was a truly transformative time of deepening our love and understanding of our Lord and Saviour Jesus. We are so thankful to my parents who introduced us and made it possible for us to attend this conference.

## What is Jesus Academia?

The best way to describe Jesus Academia is by invoking Rivendell from _The Lord of the Rings_—a peaceful refuge where disciples of Jesus, from all walks of life, are invited to retreat, deepen their relationship with Christ for a week, and return to the world with renewed purpose and vision. During the 55th session, 25 adults and 10 children attended, many returning for their second, third, or fourth time.

Attendees are consistently amazed by three things: the stunning surroundings of the Jesus Academia grounds and mansion; the warm hospitality and sumptuous feasts; and the transformative teaching of Pastor John Ko. Additionally, we enjoy sweet Christian fellowship.

Jesus Academia is located in Oyster Bay, Long Island, NY, in the Sagamore neighbourhood, home to Theodore Roosevelt, one of my favourite U.S. presidents. This ultra-wealthy area is known for vast properties—where “next door” often means a 400-meter distance, with forests and wild deer separating homes. Every house is grand. For context, all 35 participants, plus a team of five who helped run the course (more on them later), were comfortably accommodated across the main house and guest lodge, with rooms to spare!

We were also blessed with a surprise snowfall during the week, which blanketed everything in snow. The 10 children spent hours playing outdoors in this winter wonderland. It was truly a blessed time for the whole family.

## Who is pastor John Suk-hee Ko?

![](/assets/IMG_6452.heic)

Jesus Academia is the brainchild of Pastor John Suk-hee Ko, now 81 years strong. After leading the U.S. Korean Christian Student Movement and the World Korean Mission Movement for over 40 years, he announced his retirement in 2016 and launched this house of learning for Jesus in 2017, personally hosting and leading around ten sessions every year from his own house.

Pastor John Ko and his mother became orphan/widow when John was just 8 years old, following the death of his father—an officer in the South Korean army—died during the Korean War, defending a hill in Junjoo. Remarkably, he still lives with his mother, now 101 years old.

From an early age, Pastor John developed a passion for literature (even apprenticing under a famous Korean poet) and immersed himself in both Western and Eastern literature and philosophy during his teens. He became a Christian early in life, crediting his mother’s unending prayer for him, and he spent his life merging his insights into the Arts and Sciences with his love and passion for Jesus. Over the years, he says he’s devoted more time and effort to stripping away elements that “miss the mark” (hamartia) of Christ’s centrality than to acquiring new knowledge. By God’s grace, this process has allowed him to sharpen his focus on Jesus, bringing all his insights into a clearer alignment with the totality of Jesus that has become the curriculum of Jesus Academia.

Pastor John embodies the essence of the Renaissance Man (or the Korean equivalent, the Sunbi): He is **a lifelong learner**—not only limited to literature and the arts (his session connecting _quantum mechanics_ and _modern cosmology_ to Jesus’ cosmic glory was especially remarkable)—but also a man of deep faithfulness and leisure. He enjoys serious hobbies such as landscape photography and painting, that enrich his well-rounded life.

## The format of Jesus Academia

Each day of the four-day session begins with morning prayer and worship from 7:30 to 8:30 AM, followed by breakfast (On day three, I was asked to [give a sermon!](/morning-sermon)). The day then consists of two 90-minute teaching sessions before lunch, and two more 90-minute sessions in the afternoon. The sessions take place in a converted garage of the guest lodge, now a comfortable classroom that seats up to 40 people.

What sets Pastor John’s teaching apart is that he delivers all his sessions from memory. The way he recalls dates, names, and details—seamlessly weaving them into this teachings—is truly remarkable. Although his teachings are all conducted in Korean, he frequently quotes in original Latin, Hebrew, Greek, Chinese, German, or French depending on the context. Like legendary lecturers such as C.S. Lewis, his teaching unfolds as **a continuous narrative**, effortlessly weaving together individual insights into a cohesive whole that is both self-contained as a session and part of a larger, beautiful tapestry for the whole week.

When speaking with participants who’ve returned for their third or fourth session, it was clear that each class differs from the last. Pastor John adapts to the audience, shifting the direction of the sessions based on the participants and their questions. He believes it would take at least 3-4 weeks to fully cover the entire curriculum, as a typical class only allows time to teach about a quarter of what he hopes to share.

## It Takes a Village: The Many Helpers

The success of each session is made possible by the dedicated volunteer team, many of whom have known Pastor John for up to 40 years. We are especially grateful to **Anthony May** and his wife, **Yang**, who drove all the way from Houston, Texas, to care for the children and provide transportation. We also express our thanks to **Rev. T. Lee** of [Lynchberg Korean Church](https://www.lynchburgkoreanchurch.com) who made the whole programme run smoothly, as well as to the **various volunteers** who led the worship sessions. The **four students** from Handong Global University and Ghent University Global Capus did all the hard-lifting and video recording, as well as myriad other services. **Another gentleman** from the church Pastor John leads took annual leave to drive his van for a day, taking all the children to the Natural History Museum in Manhattan. On the last day, Pastor John’s son **Pastor Christopher Ko** gifted us all beautifully designed “Jesus Academia” T-shirts to take home as souvenirs. For these, we are truly grateful.

Above all, we must acknowledge **Dr. Hyangsook Kim**, who has devoted her life—sacrificing her time and resources—to make these sessions happen. She even cooks for everyone out of her own pocket. She attends every single session (even though this is her 55th time attending!) and helps Pastor John in innumerable ways. These acts of sacrificial love truly embody the spirit of Jesus Academia, contributing to the other-worldly atmosphere that makes it so special: a taste of heaven on earth.

Last but not least (and I will cover this part in more detail in [the last part](/jesus-academia-3) on _Conatus_), our thanks to **Mrs Ko**, who was ever present by Pastor John’s side and served us sacrificially in the kitchen. It was also so lovely to see **Pastor John’s mother** who often graced us with her presence and with her smile.

## What is Pastor John Ko’s vision? Jesus Revolution

Pastor John’s vision for Jesus Academia is simple: to spark a true Jesus Revolution for our time. He quotes Luke 12:49 to say that this is the deep desire of Jesus for this world:

> “I came to send fire on the earth, and how I wish it were already kindled!”
> 
> Luke 12:49

While worldly revolutions are driven by men aiming to change the external world, the Jesus Revolution Pastor John envisions is a movement of God that transforms the internal hearts of men. Drawing on his deep knowledge of the 1960s Jesus Movement in California, Pastor John believes that God works through a single man fully surrendered to His will. When that “spark” of one person is combined with the mighty wind of the Holy Spirit, an entire generation can be swept up in God’s movement.

For God’s revolution to take place within us, we must first understand, through historical literature and philosophy, the nature of the “old” and “new” regimes in our hearts. As God transforms us from the “old man” (Das Mann) to the new creation in Christ, we must also expand our view of Christ in alignment with the full revelation of Scripture and the guidance of the Holy Spirit. This, in essence, is what Jesus Academia is all about.

I cannot possibly capture all the vast material and the insights from the week, but below are some vignettes of key concepts and teachings that, I hope, convey the spirit what was shared.

### Mimesis vs Diegesis

The call of Christ is not merely to admire Him from a distance or to know His story in our minds alone—it is to _imitate_ Him with our lives. As Paul urged us in 1 Corinthians 11:1, “Imitate me, as I imitate Christ,” and in Galatians 2:20, “I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me.” Our aim is _mimesis_ (μίμησις)—to become so aligned with Christ that His life becomes our life, His character becomes our character.

However, there is a _nemesis_ (Νέμεσις) within each of us, the old self that clings to pride, sin, self-reliance, and the _status quo_, resisting the transformative work of the Holy Spirit. This is the internal battle we face daily—the fight between the new self, which is being shaped in Christ’s image, and the old self, which tries to drag us back into spiritual complacency.

But here is the key: What often opposes true _mimesis_ is not the _nemesis_ inside of us or other external forces—it is the more subtle enemy of _diegesis_ (διήγησις). We can get caught in the trap of merely _talking_ about Jesus—discussing His death, resurrection, and teachings—and convince ourselves that understanding His story is enough. We become experts in the narrative of Christ, but fail to step into the narrative ourselves. We could spend our whole lives in the church, rehearsing doctrines, knowing all the right things, yet never _become_ what we know—never _live_ what we believe.

The reality is this: while most of us are busy in the _diegesis_—talking about Jesus—God call us to _mimesis_—to _**live out**_ Jesus. To _become_ His hands and feet, His voice, His light in this world. Let us not waste our lives in comfortable theological debates while the world around us is desperate for true disciples—those who don’t just know the way, but walk in it. Let us fight the good fight of mimesis. Let the Holy Spirit transform us into the very likeness of Jesus Christ, from the inside out, so that when the world looks at us, they see not us—they see Christ in us, the hope of glory!

### The True Heart

In the pursuit of mimesis, one key concept to grasp is that of **True Heart** (참 마음, 진심). The Bible frequently speaks of the whole and undivided heart, emphasising that that this is what God requires from us. Interestingly, the Korean word for “True” is the same as “Full” (참-차다-채우다)ーjust as we are to fill our hearts to the brim with nothing but all things pertaining to Jesus.

Hebrews 10:22 calls us to approach God with a “true heart”—a heart that is genuine, sincere, and unmoved by the deceptions of this world. The Hebrew word for “true” is _Amen_, signifying truth, trustworthiness, and reliability. This “true heart” is transformative. When it enters a son, he becomes a model of filial piety (효), honouring his parents with sacrificial love, respect, and integrity. When it enters a servant, he becomes loyal and faithful, devoted to his master’s will. When it enters a man, he becomes a faithful husband, loving his wife with sacrificial devotion.

This world is full of calculations, falsehoods, and deception, yet the heart of man is the most deceitful of all (Jeremiah 17:9). Only when Jesus Christ is fully manifested in us—“it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me” (Galatians 2:20)—can we achieve this “true heart,” this _Amen_. To attain to this true heart before God and men, we must be filled to the brim with Christ, the source of all truth. The true heart is powerful; it moves people, inspires action, and makes them your allies forever, for it mirrors the very heart of God.

### Nature of Faith

Alongside a true heart, Hebrews 10:22 calls us to approach God with “the full assurance of faith.” The entire Christian life, from beginning to end, can be understood as a growth in faith through discipline. Even Spiritual Gifts given by the Holy Spirit are meant to serve the training of faith for the benefit of the Church, the body of Christ. Therefore, it is crucial that we fully grasp the nature of faith.

For over a thousand years, Christendom wrestled with the question of whether faith is primarily an intellectual assent (faith as reason) or a heartfelt devotion (faith as emotion and will). This debate, known as the Faith and Reason Controversy, explored how faith is understood and experienced, and how it fits into the broader framework of salvation. **Søren Kierkegaard**, a 19th-century philosopher, concluded that true faith is a paradox that transcends both reason and emotion. After exhausting all human faculties—reason, emotion, and will—faith cannot be grasped by our own understanding. Rather, it is a divine paradox, a “leap of faith,” where the individual shifts from a self-centred worldview to a God-centric worldview. This leap, an act of freedom through the Holy Spirit, involves just receiving God’s Word and work, fully trusting in Him. Kierkegaard wrote that faith is not a logical or emotional process, but a transformative, personal response to the mystery of God’s revelation, marked by obedience and trust in the infinite.

### Tents of Kedar vs Curtains of Solomon

To understanding this shift from a self-centred worldview to one focused on God, let us consider the Biblical contrast between the _Tents of Kedar_ vs _Curtains of Solomon_.

In Song of Songs 1:5, the “Tents of Kedar” and the “Curtains of Solomon” represents two vastly different views of our worth and identity. The Tents of Kedar are rugged, temporary, and humble, representing the nomadic, weathered dwellings of the Bedouins. In contrast, the Curtains of Solomon, which cover the divine glory and majesty of the Temple, are adorned in gold and splendour. While they may appear similar from the outside, they reflect vastly different realities.

This contrast echoes in Job 38-40, where God reveals His cosmic grandeur to Job in the midst of suffering, urging him to rise to the divine perspective—one of majesty, splendour, glory, and beauty (Job 40:10). Likewise, today God calls us His precious children, inviting us to transcend our earthly, Kedar-like view of ourselves and see ourselves as He does: as the Curtains of Solomon, full of divine majesty, splendour, glory, and beauty. In short, clothed with the righteousness of Jesus. This transformation is what Paul prays for in Ephesians 3:19, that we may be filled with the fullness of God, reflecting His majestic image.

### The Power of Study

While we must be cautious not to fall into the _diegesis_ trap—learning for the sake of intellectual knowledge alone—Pastor John laments the current state of the church. Too many Christians are content with a basic, Sunday School-level understanding of Jesus and are unwilling to engage in _the lifelong, serious study of Him_. In contrast, Buddhism encourages and reveres serious study as a noble pursuit _per se_, highlighting the stark difference in attitudes toward learning and spiritual growth. Similarly, _the central tenet_ of Confucius’s life and teaching is **study** (學), underscoring the importance of lifelong learning.

Pastor John asks, “Why did Jesus choose Paul, in addition to His twelve disciples?” He also wonders, “Why did God allow Paul to author so many books of the New Testament?” What sets Paul apart is his relentless pursuit of deeper personal knowledge of Christ after his life-changing encounter with Him. From his Road to Damascus incident, Paul dedicated himself to lifelong pursuit of growing in the grace and knowledge of His Lord and Saviour.

I resonate deeply with this emphasis on _lifelong learning_. During my time at Jesus College, Cambridge, my father often reminded me, “You never graduate from Jesus College!” The idea of never ceasing to learn was central to my education and personal growth. Similarly, when my father suggested naming my daughter _Bae Oori_ (배우리), meaning “**I will learn**” in Korean, he wanted us to embody this principle—a constant reminder to never stop growing in both knowledge and grace. Let us pursue an unceasing journey of growth in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.

### The balance between Centripetal vs Centrifugal Years

Paul’s life offers a profound lesson in balance, particularly after his transformative encounter with Jesus. For the next 34 years, Paul’s life exemplified a delicate equilibrium between inward retreat into greater intimacy with Christ and outward ministry for the glory of Christ. If we break down his years, we can see this balance clearly. Of his 34 years, 17 were “centripetal” years—time spent drawing closer to Jesus in study, contemplation, and personal devotion. These included 3 years in Arabia, 8 years in Tarsus, and several years in prison, all of which were spent deepening his relationship with Christ.

The remaining 17 years of Paul’s life were “centrifugal” years, where he was sent out on four missionary journeys throughout the known world. During this time, he planted churches, ministered to believers in Antioch and Ephesus, and mentored disciples such as Timothy. He also wrote 18 books of the New Testament, while praying without ceasing and constantly turning his focus back to Jesus. For Paul, everything revolved around Christ—the inward depth of his study and devotion fuelled the outward expression of his ministry.

How many of us, as Christians—whether pastors, ministers, or missionaries—can strike this same balance as Paul did? Are we not often like Martha, busy with countless tasks and distractions, while neglecting the deeper, more intimate focus on Jesus that Mary exemplified, sitting at His feet? We must learn to get the “17-17 balance” right—drawing near to Jesus in our personal lives so that this depth becomes the wellspring of our ministry and mission in the world.

## To Be Continued

In the teachings of Pastor John so far, believers are invited to a deeper, lifelong pursuit of intimacy with Jesus. Drawing from Paul’s example, who spent equal parts of his life in inward devotion and outward service, Pastor John highlights the importance of a life of continuous learning, shaped by the transformative power of mimesis (imitation of Christ). This journey requires a “true heart” that is fully surrendered and filled with Christ, growing in both the knowledge and grace of the Lord, so that believers may reflect His glory both in their private lives and in their ministries. Ultimately, the goal is a Jesus Revolution—one that begins with the heart and overflows into the world, marked by sacrificial love, true discipleship, and an unwavering commitment to spiritual growth.

Even after all of the above, the truth is I still haven’t covered half of what I learned during the week from Pastor John! I will take a break here and follow up with [Part Two](/jesus-academia-2) to continue my reflections.
