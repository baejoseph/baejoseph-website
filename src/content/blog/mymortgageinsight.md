Today is quite a significant day for me. For the first time, I got paid for my outside-of-work coding work.

오늘 처음으로 직장 외의 코딩 일로 (소량의) 돈을 벌었다. 정말 뿌듯하다. 주여 감사합니다~! 더 큰 일의 시작이 되게 하소서.

A bit of context for the coding work/project: The UK is in the midst of the “cost of living” crisis, and I started to see a lot of people around me who have their fixed-term mortgage agreements coming to an end soon and who are worried/fearful about the increase in their monthly mortgage payments due to the recent interest rate hikes. They knew that the mortgage payments would increase, and therefore their living costs too, but they didn’t yet know exactly by how much, and this contributed to a feeling of helplessness that comes with the uncertainty about the future. I wondered if there is a way to empower them by replacing that “fear of the future unknown” with a certain knowledge of “increase of X pounds” that would hopefully enable better planning for tomorrow. And I wanted to do that with a tool that is as intuitive and easy to use as possible (just move some sliders!).

I hope it’s a start of greater things to come! TYG!
