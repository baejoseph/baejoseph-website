If you are truly awake—if you are not compromised by friendship with the world (James 4:4) or entangled in the cares of this life like seed choked by thorns (Mark 4:19)—then deep in your spirit, you already know: **The end of all things is at hand**. You don’t need the media, world events, or even my words to tell you that. _The Holy Spirit testifies within you_ that we are living in the final moments before the return of our Lord Jesus Christ. The world scoffs, and sadly, so do many professing Christians. But those who are truly longing for His appearing—the ones who will receive the Crown of Righteousness (2 Timothy 4:8)—are not caught off guard. They are watching. They are ready. Are you?

What follows will be a litmus test of that readiness. Many say, “Of course, Jesus could come back today, and that’s fine with me,” but when confronted with the possibility that His return is **much** sooner than they expected, they suddenly become uneasy, defensive, or _even angry_. Why? Could it be that their hearts are still tied to the things of this world? Could they have plans, dreams, and ambitions that they don’t want disturbed, even by the Second Coming of their Lord and Saviour? If the thought of Jesus’ imminent return unsettles you rather than fills you with joy, ask yourself: “Am I truly longing for His appearing, or have I become too comfortable here?”

## “But no one knows the day or the hour”

Some will lazily quote, “No one knows the **day** or the **hour**” (Matthew 24:36) as a way to dismiss any discussion of _timing_. But Jesus never said we couldn’t discern the **month** or the **year**—in fact, He commanded us to **watch** and **be ready** (Matthew 24:42-44). We are expected to recognise the signs and understand the times, just as the sons of Issachar did (1 Chronicles 12:32). Furthermore, Revelation 9:15 explicitly mentions the **hour**, the **day**, the **month**, and the **year**, proving that God does have an exact timeline. Yet so many pastors today still say, “Oh, it could be another thousand years!” This is negligence at best and deception at worst. The truth is, God has given us everything we need in His Word to see that His return is near. My challenge to you is this: **Will you be like the noble Bereans** (Acts 17:11)**?** Will you search the Scriptures for yourself, with a sincere and eager heart? Or will you dismiss this outright, unwilling to even consider that we might be on the very cusp of the greatest event in human history? I urge you—do the hard work. Open your Bible. Examine prophecy carefully. Keep watch. Be ready. Because whether you believe it or not, **Jesus is coming to get us soon**.

## The End of the End of the End Times

For the past 2,000 years, we have been living in the **End Times**—the “Church Age”, or “the Age of Grace”—beginning with the first Pentecost and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit in Acts 2. However, Jesus made it clear that His return would be preceded by an intensification of prophetic events, culminating in a final generation that would witness **all things** coming to pass (Matthew 24:34). Many generations of Christians have longed for His appearing, but **only we** have the decisive marker that no prior generation had: **the rebirth of Israel**. On May 14, 1948, the modern State of Israel was miraculously established in a single day (Isaiah 66:8), fulfilling the prophecy of the fig tree putting forth leaves (Matthew 24:32-33). This event signalled the **End of the End Times**—the final countdown to Jesus’ return. But now, something even greater has happened: the **End of the End of the End Times** has begun, marked by the 2020 global upheaval and the astonishing alignment of biblical prophecy in our day.

[Dr. Christian Widener](https://endtimesberean.com/about-christian-widener/) has laid out compelling evidence that we are now living in the final seven years before Christ’s return. His findings centre around the **Daniel 70-week prophecy**, revealing a _double fulfilment_—a prophetic telescoping [often found in Scripture](/two). The first count, widely recognized, spans 490 years from the **Decree of Artaxerxes I in 458 BC** to rebuild Jerusalem, leading exactly to **the crucifixion of Jesus in AD 33**. However, Dr. Widener has discovered a second fulfilment: **another 490-year count, starting from the 1537 decree of Suleiman the Magnificent to rebuild Jerusalem “with plaza and moat,” leading to the year AD 2027**.

Location of the Decree on the Temple Mount

\[UPDATE: I actually visited this place “Sabil Bab el Atm” on the Temple Mount and [saw the plaque with my own eyes](https://youtu.be/02E2c1gV9Ps) during our Easter 2025 visit to Israel!\] If this is correct, then we are currently inside the final seven-year Tribulation, which **began in 2020 and will culminate in the Second Coming of Christ in the year 2027**. And because Jesus promised to take us (the Church Saints) home prior to the full outpouring of God’s wrath on earth, **[this means our imminent Rapture is even closer at hand](/rapture)**.

## The Year 2020: The Beginning of the Tribulation

Several prophetic events took place in 2020 that align remarkably with the beginning of the final seven years:

-   **January 28, 2020** – The **Israel-Palestine Peace Plan** was [formally announced by the first Trump Administration](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Peace-to-Prosperity-0120.pdf). This was significant because **Daniel 9:27** speaks of a covenant being confirmed “with many for one week.”
-   **March 11, 2020** – **The** **World Health Organisation declared COVID-19 a global pandemic**. This event led to worldwide lockdowns, mass government control shutting down church services while keeping nightclubs and bars open, and the rapid push for digital tracking—preparing the infrastructure for global governance and the eventual Mark of the Beast system.
-   **March 27, 2020** – Pope Francis, in an unprecedented moment, **addressed the entire world in an empty Vatican Square**, calling for divine intervention. This eerie scene looked almost like a counterfeit of biblical prophecy, setting the stage for the rise of a one-world religious system.
-   **Autumn of 2020** – The **[Abraham Accords](https://www.state.gov/the-abraham-accords) were signed**, beginning with the **UAE** on August 13, **Bahrain** on September 15, **Morocco** on December 10, and **Sudan** on January 6, 2021. This agreement, along with the above Israel-Palestine peace plan, bears striking resemblance to the **covenant with many** mentioned in Daniel 9:27.

## The October 7, 2023 Attack and the Abomination of Desolation

Dr. Widener [presents strong reasons](https://endtimesberean.com/2024/04/20/rethinking-the-abomination-of-desolation/) to believe that the **October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel**, which happened exactly 1290 days after the March 27, 2020 Pope prayer, was the first part of the **Abomination of Desolation** (Matthew 24:15). This claim might shock many, but consider the facts:

-   **The** **Temple Institute of Israel** had been preparing for the **red heifer sacrifice**, a biblically mandated step necessary for the purification of the future Third Temple (Numbers 19:1-10). Five unblemished red heifers, raised in Texas and transported to Israel, were ready to be sacrificed, signalling that preparations for the Third Temple were well underway.
-   **Hamas named their October 7 attack “Al-Aqsa Flood”** and **explicitly stated that their goal was to stop the planned red heifer sacrifice**. This was not just another Islamic terrorist attack against the Jews—this was a direct attempt to prevent the Jewish people from reestablishing Temple worship **on the Temple Mount (Al-Aqsa)**.
-   While the attack took place in southern Israel, **its connection to the Temple Mount is undeniable**. Jesus warned His people (the Jews) that when the Abomination of Desolation is seen “standing in” the holy place (Matthew 24:15)—a phrase that in Greek can also mean “justified on”—those in Judea must _flee to the mountains_. This is exactly what happened on 7th October: some 200,000 Israelis across the Judean plains were internally displaced. They all **fled Eastwards to the mountain regions** (towards Jerusalem), and many who hesitated met a horrific fate at the hands of the bloodthirsty Hamas terrorists, _who specifically targeted pregnant women and children_. The atrocities recorded on their own body cameras were beyond comprehension—brutal, deliberate, and unparalleled in their savagery.

## The Israel-Gaza War and Psalm 83

I am especially thankful to my friend [Neville Stephens](http://nevillestephenstaffy.blogspot.com) for showing me how the 2023-2024 **war between Israel and Hamas, Hezbollah, and other Islamic factions** eerily matches the nations and groups listed in Psalm 83:

-   **Tents of Edom** – Palestinians and Southern Jordanians
-   **Ishmaelites** – Saudis, as Ishmael is the father of the Arabs
-   **Moab** – Palestinians and Central Jordanians
-   **Hagarenes** – Egyptians (Hagar, the matriarch, was Egyptian)
-   **Gebal** – Hezbollah and Northern Lebanese
-   **Ammon** – Palestinians and Northern Jordanians
-   **Amalek** – Arabs of the Sinai region
-   **Philistia** – Hamas (Gaza Strip)
-   **Tyre** – Hezbollah (Southern Lebanon)
-   **Assyria** – Modern Syria and Northern Iraq

And just as the Psalm 83 prophecies (Dr. Widener also points to ), this war came to nothing, spectacularly ending with the famous Pager precision-strike, the decimation of Hezbollah leadership, and the execution of Hamas Chief Yahya Sinwar on 16 October 2024.

We are literally living through end times Biblical prophecy!

## 2025: We Are Now Between the Fifth and Sixth Seals  

Dr. Widener believes that the **first five Seals of Revelation 6 have already been broken**:

-   **First Seal (White Horse)** – “_he that sat on him had a bow \[toxon\]; and a crown \[in Latin, Corona\] was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer_,” a vivid description of a global pandemic that swept across the whole world and the forced vaccine mandates and lockdowns and the rampant “trust the Science” deception spread by the elite mainstream media in concert with the corrupt WHO/CCP/CIA etc.
-   **Second Seal (Red Horse)** – “_power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another_.” This could point to the **2020 BLM riots** and the subsequent global rise of **Critical Race Theory (CRT) and neo-Marxist ideology**, which have fueled division and hostility worldwide. These movements **fractured societies along racial, sexual, and socioeconomic lines**, redefining people into **oppressor and oppressed** classes. The spirit of lawlessness and hatred that erupted in 2020 continues to spread, fulfilling Jesus’ warning that in the last days, _“lawlessness will abound, and the love of many will grow cold”_ (Matthew 24:12).
-   **Third Seal (Black Horse)** – “_he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand. And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of wheat for a denarius, and three measures of barley for a denarius; and do not harm the oil and the wine_.” This strikingly resembles the **global inflation crisis** that followed the **2020 pandemic**, when governments worldwide **pumped unprecedented amounts of fiat currency into circulation**—with the Biden administration alone injecting over **$5 trillion**. The result? **Soaring prices for food, energy, and basic necessities**, creating a worldwide cost-of-living crisis, while at the same time, **the wealthiest elites amassed unprecedented riches**—just as the prophecy indicates, where essential goods become scarce for the masses while luxury remains untouched. While inflation has always existed, its **truly global** scale in this era is **historically unprecedented**, marking yet another prophetic milestone before the return of Christ.
-   **Fourth Seal (Pale Horse)** – “_and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hades followed with him. And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth_.” This could point to the staggering rise in **excess deaths worldwide**, particularly following the **mandated mRNA COVID-19 vaccines**, which were **forced upon billions**. By August 2024, over **70.7% of the global population** had received at least one dose, and the data shows alarming trends: in the **U.S. alone, between 2022 and 2024, there were 1.5 million excess deaths per year**—a catastrophic figure. But as Dr. Christian Widener notes, **the Seals do not cease but intensify** throughout the Tribulation. What began with the Pale Horse in **2020-2024**—whether through war, famine, disease, or mass medical deception—will likely **accelerate exponentially**, until ultimately, a **full quarter of the world’s population perishes, just as Revelation foretells**.
-   **Fifth Seal (Martyrs)** – “_under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held_.” This prophecy unmistakably speaks of **widespread martyrdom of believers in the End Times**, and the numbers today are staggering. According to **Open Doors International**, **5,621 Christians were martyred in 2023**, and **by September 30, 2024, another 4,998 had already been killed**—shattering historical records. Today, on average, one believer somewhere in the world is martyred every two hours or less. These figures surpass even the brutal persecution of the Roman Empire, proving that global hostility toward true followers of Christ is reaching unprecedented levels. The world is growing darker, and the cost of standing for Jesus is rising. Yet, Scripture assures us that **those who endure to the end will receive the crown of life** (Revelation 2:10). The blood of the martyrs cries out, and soon, the Lamb Himself will answer.

## What lies ahead: the Ezekiel 38 War and the Sixth Seal

Dr. Christian Widener believes that the breaking of the **Sixth Seal** corresponds to the climactic events at the **end of the Ezekiel 38 War**—a moment he also associates with the **Rapture of the Church.** What is truly astonishing is that, just as the **Israel-Hamas War** aligned with the **Psalm 83 coalition**, the nations prophesied in **Ezekiel 38**—led by **Russia, Turkey, and Iran**—are **at this very moment forming military coalitions, severing diplomatic ties with Israel, and repositioning their forces for an inevitable strike.** This is not speculation; this is happening **right now**. We are literally watching **End Times prophecy unfold before our eyes.** \[UPDATE 13th June 2025: Israel’s “Rising Lion” strike against the Iranian Nuclear facilities and eliminating almost all military leaders in one fell swoop!\]

## The Individual End vs. the The End of the World

At this point, some might argue, _“Instead of focusing on the end of the world—which no one knows, not even Jesus (Matthew 24:36)—shouldn’t we be more concerned with the end of our own lives? After all, death is inevitable for everyone, and remembering that should be enough to lead a holy life.”_ And in a sense, they are absolutely right! **Each of us will face our own appointed time, and remembering that (Memento Mori) may be enough to motivate godly living in this world.** But is that _all_ Jesus commanded? The Bible does not merely tell us to live in personal readiness for death—it also **commands us to watch for His return** (Matthew 24:42-44). The Lord repeatedly emphasised that His Second Coming would be preceded by specific signs, and He rebuked those who failed to discern the signs of His First Coming. If personal holiness were the only concern, then why would Jesus and the apostles spend so much time warning us about the **specific events leading up to His return**? No, the expectation of His imminent coming is not a distraction—it is a **commanded posture of the faithful (Colossians 3:1-4).**

## “But Who are you? Who granted you the authority to say these things?”

But who am I—or who is Dr. Christian Widener—to claim we see something that **the mainstream evangelical leaders have missed?** A fair question. But let’s not forget: **the mainstream Jewish religious leaders also missed Jesus’ first coming.** Why? Because it didn’t match _their_ specific expectations or _their_ specific interpretations of Old Testament prophecy. Could the same mistake be happening today? And as for me? I’ve never set foot in a seminary, and I consider that a blessing. **I have been spared the [theological biases](/theology) and denominational systems that often blind even the most learned scholars.** Instead, I have simply read the Bible—**cover to cover, [year after year](/mccheyne), without preconceptions.** And the truth is, **anyone** with a sincere heart and a willingness to search the Scriptures (Acts 17:11) can see the same thing. You don’t need a degree. You don’t need approval from mainstream theology. **You just need the Word of God—and eyes to see.**

## Isn’t Eschatology too Divisive? Should we not focus on what unites us instead?

The time for hiding behind _"we must not be too divisive"_ is over. **We are living in the end of the end of the end times.** Jesus did not command us to ignore prophecy for the sake of “unity”—The Bible commands us to **watch** (Matthew 24:42), to **discern the times** (Luke 12:56), and to **love His appearing** (2 Timothy 4:8). The sad reality is that many churches today have abandoned biblical eschatology in favour of a watered-down, unity-at-all-costs Christianity that **fails to confront the reality of our times.** Yes, we must faithfully **[preach the Gospel](/evangelism)** and **[engage in righteous governance](/leftism-eng)** to push back against corruption and leftist totalitarianism, but we cannot forget the third and ultimate realm of the Christian life: **[the eternal realm](/three).** True justice and righteousness will only be fully realised **when Christ returns to establish His Millennial Kingdom**—not through human efforts to "transform" this world. Many in the church today, embracing amillennial or postmillennial theology, believe they can usher in Christ’s kingdom _before_ His return, but this is **a dangerous delusion** no different from leftist utopianism. The world will not be saved through politics (yes, this applies even to [the amazing second Trump Administration in 2025](/closure)), activism, or social movements—it will only be saved **when Jesus personally returns to reign with us and “make all things new”.** Only a biblical and healthy eschatology will guard a Christian’s heart against the allure of Christian Dominionism—a concerning trend in the U.S. today.

## How Then Shall We Live?

In light of the limited time we have until Rapture, how then should we live our lives today?

-   Firstly, **faithfulness**. We are to be faithful in all that we do: whether at work, at home, in the school, etc. Upon our Rapture and the glorious encounter with our Lord, may we hear Him say, “Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master’s happiness!”
-   Secondly, we are to **tell the Gospel** and our testimony to all the world with a greater sense of urgency. Remember, the full Gospel (1 Corinthians 15:3-4) must include the somber warning of Jesus’ Second Coming—this time not as a Saviour, but as the Judge of all the living and the dead.
-   Thirdly, we are to **wait**. Let us master the art of waiting on God: He will renew your strength every day (Isaiah 40:31)! Wait with an eager anticipation. Be counted worthy to receive the Crown of Righteousness (2 Timothy 4:8).
-   Lastly, make many happy memories with your family! **Go travel** the world, especially Israel, especially if you have not already done so—you had better get used to Jerusalem; you will be visiting it often throughout the Millennial Reign.

## The Time to Watch and Be Ready is NOW

The evidence is overwhelming. We are no longer merely in the End Times—we are in **the end of the end of the end times**. Many will dismiss this, just as they dismissed Noah’s warnings before the flood. But Jesus **commanded us** to watch (Matthew 24:42) and to understand the times like the sons of Issachar (1 Chronicles 12:32). The Bereans were considered **noble** because they diligently searched the Scriptures (Acts 17:11)—will you do the same?

If you are still skeptical, I urge you: **search these things out for yourself**. Open your Bible. Look at the prophecies. But most of all, listen to the voice of the Holy Spirit—the Spirit who testifies with our spirit that we are children of God—He will guide you into all truths, and as you humble yourself through fasting and prayer and make yourself more sensitive to His leading, I believe He will testify with your spirit that indeed, Our Bridegroom is coming to fetch us soon.

_Maranatha! Even so, come, Lord Jesus!_

## FAQ

The response to this email has been all over the spectrum. Below are some frequenty-asked questions.

#### Q: _I thought you were a pre-tribber. What changed?_

A: Yes, you’re right! Obviously, you **can’t** believe in a **pre-tribulation rapture** (that the rapture happens before the 7-year tribulation) **and** at the same time believe that we are already **more than halfway into the 7-year tribulation**—since no rapture has happened yet! Given the overwhelming evidence, my position has shifted to what I now call “**post-mid-trib, pre-wrath rapture**”.

* * *

#### Q: _But doesn’t Revelation say that the seven-year tribulation (or at least the second half of it) will be a time when the full wrath of God is poured out on the earth?_

A: That’s what I used to think too—at least regarding the second half. But **Dr. Widener’s argument makes a lot of sense.** If a **global catastrophe** were to last **years**, the ensuing collapse of global and local logistics (**no clean water, no food in grocery stores, etc.**) would **wipe out most of the global population** in today’s hyper-connected world. A much more **realistic** scenario is that **God’s full wrath is poured out over a very short period** at the **end** of the 7-year period, just before the build up of the Armageddon War at the end of which Christ returns WITH HIS SAINTS in glory. Also, this aligns with what Jesus said:

> _As it was in the days of Noah_, so will it be at the coming of the Son of Man. For in the days before the flood, people were **eating** _and_ **drinking**_,_ **marrying** _and_ **giving in marriage**_, up to the day Noah entered the ark_. And they were oblivious until the flood came and swept them all away. _So will it be at the coming of the Son of Man_.
> 
> Matthew 24:37-39

And before that final outpouring of wrath? **The Church Saints will be raptured.**

* * *

#### Q: _I want to investigate this further. What’s a good place to start?_

A: I’m glad you asked, fellow End Times Berean! The best place to start is Dr. Christian Widener’s [website](https://endtimesberean.com), where he has both of his books available as free PDF downloads. He also has hour-long [video teachings](https://www.youtube.com/@EndTimesBerean) on all of this, but I personally find his interviews to be the best introduction. **[Here’s a great one to start with](https://youtu.be/flanmAVD8KY).**

* * *

#### Q: _So what does this change about our lives here and now?_

A: For a **faithful Christian**? **Nothing!** Keep living as you are—preaching Christ, being watchful, and staying faithful. For a more detailed answer, see the **section above: “How Then Shall We Live?”**

* * *

#### Q: _What if you are wrong? How certain are you about all this?_

A: If I wasn’t **certain**, I wouldn’t have written this. And honestly? I had to **cut out a lot** to keep this short. There’s even **more** evidence I haven’t mentioned, like:

-   **The Millennial Day** and **Six-Day Creation** pattern (2 Peter 3:8, _Epistle of Barnabas_, AD 100)
-   The year 2027 being the final **Jubilee Year** (as 574 BC was one, _cf. Ezekiel 40:1 & Leviticus 25:9_. Also, AD 27 was a Jubilee year according to Jesus, _see Luke 4:18-21_. The chances of 574 BC, AD 27, and AD 2027 _all_ being Jubilee years? 1/2500. )
-   **Hosea 6:1-3** prophecy
-   Planetary alignments and various **signs in the sky**
-   The rapid and exponential development of **A.I.** towards AGI/ASI.
-   **Transhumanism** (Stargate Project and mRNA cancer vaccines) and the rise of **Nephilim** through sexual unions between fallen angels and humans, _just as in the days of Noah_ (_see Genesis 6:1-4_)
-   Prevalent **predictive programming** (aliens, UAP, etc) by Hollywood **to explain away** the imminent Rapture.
-   Billionaires building **personal survival bunkers** costing upwards of $100m since 2022 (_see Revelation 6:15_)

The **total weight of independent evidence is overwhelming.** Unless your **prior probability ([in a Bayesian inference sense](/bayes)) is absolute zero**, the **posterior probability** of this being true is **easily above 95%**.

That said—**even if** a few years down the line this turns out not to be true, **would I regret it? Not at all.** Living each day **fully committed** to God, **expecting His glorious return, and faithfully fulfilling my responsibilities with a blessed hope and eternal perspective?**

That’s a life **worth living**—**regardless.**
