The palms whispered.  
The waters sang.  
Silence ruled.

We walked down.

Empty nets dragged heavy through the dark.  
Futility without Him.

“Children, have you any food?”  
“Cast the net on the right side!”

It was the first call all over again.

Peter heard.  
“It is the Lord!”  
Peter plunged in.  
No shame. No fear. Just love.

_Mensa Christi._  
Not a story.  
Not a memory.  
An invitation. Solid as rock.

A silence that spoke of forgiveness.  
And love.

“Bar-Jonah Simon, lovest thou Me more than these?”

Three chances.  
Three wounds healed.  
Three confessions wrung from a burning heart.

Old failures drowned.  
New life breathed.  
We returned.

The lake kissed our feet.  
We plunged in.  
No pride. No fear. Just love.

Feed My lambs.  
Tend My sheep.  
Feed My sheep.

The call was clear.

The nets were full. 153.  
We rose in Him.

Children laughed.  
Angels circled.  
Heaven blessed.

At Thy Word.

Cast the net.  
Take the risk.  
Trust His Power.

No turning back.
