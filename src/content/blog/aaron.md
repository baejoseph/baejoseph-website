I really like [@AaronInWriting](https://x.com/AaronInWriting) on 𝕏. He really seems to get this “[three separate realms](/three)” balance right. Below are some of his tweets, quoted in full.

🇮🇱Never confuse recognition of Israel’s eschatological significance with blanket validation of all her actions.

🇮🇱Never confuse expectation of Israel’s messianic redemption with acceptance of Israel’s apostate current condition.

🇮🇱Never confuse “Support for Israel” with “Israel can do no wrong”

🇮🇱Never confuse God’s preservation of Israel as God’s acceptance of Talmudic Judaism.

🇮🇱Never confuse Israel’s ultimate elect status with affirmation of her present state.

🇮🇱Never confuse Love for the Jews with love for their religion.

🇮🇱Never confuse not boasting against the natural branches with not calling them to repent.

▪️Israel is chosen for both judgment AND salvation.

▪️Slacken this tension and fall into grievous error.

🇮🇱 I remain absolutely astonished at the sheer number of people who are simply unable (or unwilling) to grasp the tension and truth of these two theological facts:

1\. Corporate Jewry/Israel is under the increasingly severe judgment of God, are the ideological enemies of the gospel of Jesus Christ, and are in need of repentance and belief in Christ as their only hope of salvation.

2\. Corporate Jewry/Israel is under divine protection and preservation by God until His established end for her as a people comes to pass. Namely, that a remnant will come to faith in Jesus Christ after passing through enormous chastisement.

Like many theological truths, the nature of Israel’s status before God is one of delicate tension, and is to be rightly understood within the conceptual paradigm of Both/And…

Israel is BOTH apostate under the judgment of God…AND beloved for the sake of the fathers.

… and is therefore sustained and preserved by that same God.

This is a tension which requires submission, not clever theological attempts at slackening.

I am a Christian, who is also a Nationalist.

Yet I am not a Dominionist, nor a proponent of an over-realized eschatological reality in which the Kingdom of God is temporally instituted by sociopolitical force, and in addition, is done so without the direct bodily presence of the King of Kings.

…Hence, I am not a Christian Nationalist.

Simple.

* * *

It’s not a matter of want for Christian values, but is rather a question of the nature and implementation of the Kingdom. This is the crux of the matter.

To institute and rule the Kingdom without the bodily presence of the King, is to betray him and stage a coup d'état.

In a word, it’s Antichrist.

Such an endeavor is not what good stewards engage in, but is rather for usurpers.

As the black cloud of end times confusion mounts around the world, It’s becoming less important to know precisely what’s going on

…and more so WHY it’s all taking place.

The geopolitical confusion factor will make the unbeliever’s compass spin wildly, but to Christians who know the overarching trajectory, we are grounded in reality and mental sobriety.

The fog of spiritual warfare and increasing Antichrist delusion, by the grace of God, is only a minor nuisance to us who have our gaze fixed upon Christ and his eschatological plan previously revealed. While the world is vexed and confused in the midst of ensuing chaos and deception, we are seated with him above in the heavenly places watching the big picture unfold with clarity.

Don’t get sucked into the fray of endlessly swirling details, and disinformation, but rather, stand aloof and watch quietly with the wide angle lens of understanding in use.

The Lord teaches and guides his own.

“ᴍᴀɴʏ ꜱʜᴀʟʟ ʙᴇ ᴘᴜʀɪꜰɪᴇᴅ, ᴀɴᴅ ᴍᴀᴅᴇ ᴡʜɪᴛᴇ, ᴀɴᴅ ᴛʀɪᴇᴅ; ʙᴜᴛ ᴛʜᴇ ᴡɪᴄᴋᴇᴅ ꜱʜᴀʟʟ ᴅᴏ ᴡɪᴄᴋᴇᴅʟʏ: ᴀɴᴅ ɴᴏɴᴇ ᴏꜰ ᴛʜᴇ ᴡɪᴄᴋᴇᴅ ꜱʜᴀʟʟ ᴜɴᴅᴇʀꜱᴛᴀɴᴅ

I’d be the first to admit that it’s excruciatingly difficult to exercise a spirit of compassion with an increasingly debauched and Christ hating world.

Yet we have to.

We Must.

—————-

We can never unhitch the proclamation of the gospel from the portrayal of Christian character. We who preach Christ, must be deliberate in showing Christ.

With our boldness in preaching, may we be equally as bold with the practice of love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control.

Until the Lord returns in the character of the Lion of Judah, we are still present with him in this age as the Suffering Servant.

Now is still a time of grace.

As hearts grow colder and darker both within the church and without, we must kindle warmth and light.

“ʟᴇᴛ ɴᴏᴛ ᴋɪɴᴅɴᴇꜱꜱ ᴀɴᴅ ᴛʀᴜᴛʜ ꜰᴏʀꜱᴀᴋᴇ ᴛʜᴇᴇ, ʙɪɴᴅ ᴛʜᴇᴍ ᴏɴ ᴛʜʏ ɴᴇᴄᴋ, ᴡʀɪᴛᴇ ᴛʜᴇᴍ ᴏɴ ᴛʜᴇ ᴛᴀʙʟᴇᴛ ᴏꜰ ᴛʜʏ ʜᴇᴀʀᴛ”

The culture war is a naturally occurring byproduct of consistent gospel proclamation.

Reverse this order and you’ve forsaken the faith.

Governmental (particularly judicial) legislation based upon Natural Law cannot be supplanted by legislation based upon special revelation until the 2nd advent of Jesus Christ.

It will never work beforehand, and is doomed to forever be an exercise in futility.

Sad but true.

This is why we save souls and await the King.

▪️I do not advocate for a totalitarian abolition of abortion under pain of death for the mother involved.

…Rather, I advocate for the preaching of the gospel to the extent that there’s no one left who would care to seek one.

▪️I do not advocate for a totalitarian abolition of homosexuality under pain of death for the participants involved.

…Rather, I advocate for the preaching of the gospel to the extent that there’s no one left who would care to enter into such a relationship.

▪️Should I vote against laws that allow/encourage the murder of infants?

\-Yes absolutely.

▪️Should I vote against laws that allow/encourage homosexual activity?

\-Yes absolutely.

▪️Do I Believe that these evils will be conquered through political and judicial activism as the sole or even primary means of action?

No, Absolutely Not.

Don’t we see that so many are seeking to kill their children and dishonor their bodies between each other because the gospel has been all but forgotten and ignored as the all-sufficient catalyst for the destruction of these sins in the hearts of sinners? Because of this, the “culture war” has filled the vacuum the exit of the gospel has created, and in accepting this exchange as a more sure and powerful way to fight against these sins, the nation is ultimately doomed to failure.

The “culture war” is the symptom of the underlying disease which is the repudiation of the gospel’s sufficiency to change individual hearts, which then bleeds into changed nations on a large scale and governmental level.

Am I saying that we shouldn’t use our ability to influence legislation against the aforementioned evils?

God forbid.

Of course not.

Yet, the sobering truth is that we do so simply because it’s the right action to take as followers of Christ, and not because we actually believe evil will be unilaterally conquered before the return of Christ.

Much of Christianity has lost sight of the fact that genuine societal change that’s truly Godly, is organically sprouted from the ground up, and not artificially constructed from the top down by way of political prowess.

When the latter method is employed by the church, a never ending battle of futility is entered into with wicked sinners endlessly pushing back.

Carnal force of will must then necessarily become reciprocally more pronounced as time goes on, until a totalitarian pseudo-Christian state emerges in order to corral the wickedness …or, should the other side win politically, a global French Revolution styled revolt comes to fruition against all that is good, godly and holy.

The hard truth is that the church ultimately loses the world down here.

…yet the body of Christ gains the souls of myriads from it, all of whom will truly retake the world in real righteousness when the New Heavens and New Earth are made manifest upon the King’s return.

Theocracy will be instituted when Christ rules with a rod of iron, and he does not give that authority to another.

Godly men display Christ, carnal men enforce him.

James 4:4 has been emblazoned upon my mind for months now:

ʏᴏᴜ ᴀᴅᴜʟᴛᴇʀᴇꜱꜱᴇꜱ, ᴅᴏ ʏᴏᴜ ɴᴏᴛ ᴋɴᴏᴡ ᴛʜᴀᴛ ꜰʀɪᴇɴᴅꜱʜɪᴘ ᴡɪᴛʜ ᴛʜᴇ ᴡᴏʀʟᴅ ɪꜱ ʜᴏꜱᴛɪʟɪᴛʏ ᴛᴏᴡᴀʀᴅ ɢᴏᴅ?

…ᴛʜᴇʀᴇꜰᴏʀᴇ ᴡʜᴏᴇᴠᴇʀ ᴡᴀɴᴛꜱ ᴛᴏ ʙᴇ ᴀ ꜰʀɪᴇɴᴅ ᴏꜰ ᴛʜᴇ ᴡᴏʀʟᴅ ᴍᴀᴋᴇꜱ ʜɪᴍꜱᴇʟꜰ ᴀɴ ᴇɴᴇᴍʏ ᴏꜰ ɢᴏᴅ.

We attempt to convince ourselves that we aren’t friends with the world because we don’t “feel” like we are.

…yet what is it that we desire?

Esteem, power, influence, prestige, control, authority?

…Fooling ourselves into believing we desire such in the name of Christ and for his honor. Our friendship with the world is measured by the level of our covetousness regarding its goods and high places, and not by our emotional disposition towards it. One can both hate the world emotionally, and yet simultaneously be deeply envious of it, and driven to procure its high places.

The genuine Holy Spirit will inspire within us a desire to be a clear contradiction to the world, marked by a peculiar and unmistakable holiness.

…While conversely, there is a sham spirit in existence, one who inspires covetousness, and the desire to subsume the world under the guise of Christly piety. This entity invokes the desire for the goods, the institutions, and high places of the world, rather than the individual lost persons within it.

Perhaps the most telling symptom of “Friendship with the world”, is the subtle desire not to be inconvenienced by the Lord’s second coming as we heap up kingdoms for ourselves in his name.

We must deeply examine our hearts in this regard.

If you don’t understand election you won’t understand the enduring status of the Jews as a recognizable and preserved people. It is with astounding irony that we find primarily the “Reformed” who very often seem to be the most unable to grasp the elect status of the corporate Jewish nation.

Not only does this meme demonstrate the demonically inspired spiritual blindness that’s currently sweeping through the ranks of western Christendom, but it also fails to acknowledge that God’s election is held and brought to fruition irrespective of the current spiritual disposition of the Jewish people.

In fact, it is because the Jew exhibits: “LMAO & \*spits” that God has regathered, and continues to regather them corporately unto a severe judgement, out of which will emerge a saved remnant who embrace Christ as their messiah.

The irony with which so many of the “Truly Reformed” judge Israel’s significance betrays an astonishing level of hypocrisy and blindness in their ranks. They themselves within their Calvinistic system were elect of God even while his dire and blasphemous spiritual enemies.

This spiritual position in which they readily acknowledge regarding themselves prior to conversion, is rejected however when it comes to the corporate Jewish people.

The reason for this is that a deep spiritual blindness has set in due to their conceitedness regarding the natural branches, their very own soteriological beliefs regarding election are held in a supremely hypocritical state of double standards.

As said before:

\-Pay attention to the Reformed clique.

The level of deception currently afoot in this particular ecclesial body is potent beyond measure and is quickly proving to be the epicenter for satanic motivation against the Jews and all things Jewish.

Cessationism is arrived at experientially and presuppositionally first and foremost.

…and then only afterward is an attempt made to bolster the experiential stance through the  employment of a cobbled together scriptural and historical hermeneutic using scotch tape and paper clips.

* * *

You are NOT an immaterial soul contained/trapped in an earthly vessel.

You are both immaterial and material simultaneously, with the lack of one or the other of these facets of being rendering you incomplete and not fully human.

Gnostic dualism comes in very subtle forms.

Material is good, holy, and becoming of God’s use and glory. The material world is intimately and inseparably tied to the immaterial to form the fullness of reality itself.

The world is paradigmatically incarnational in its most fundamental essence.

…just as we would expect from an incarnational God, who made, uses, and redeems matter unto his perfect ends.

* * *

The radical Left is the instrument of preliminary social demoralization, acting in a preparatory fashion for the counteracting emergence of the far Right, which will come in hot to save the day.

The latter however, is the true instrument of deception for Christians.

The far Left is nothing but fodder for the coming Totalitarian Right-wing zeitgeist to consume so as to appear truly righteous. I believe it is out of this victorious triumphalism that the false peace & safety will be made manifest.

* * *

A fundamental paradigm shift is taking place all across Christendom in preparation for Antichrist:

▪️The way of the cross is being exchanged for the way of the sword

▪️Mercy is being exchanged for militancy

▪️Suffering is being exchanged for fleeting comfort

▪️Godly Meekness is being exchanged for carnal bellicosity

▪️Focus on Eternality is being exchanged for temporality

▪️Fruit of the Spirit is being exchanged for fleshly attributes of power.

▪️Tarrying upon the Lord is being exchanged for forced imposition of his presence.

▪️Self sacrificial Love is being exchanged for self preservation

▪️Forgiveness is being exchanged for a fighting spirit

▪️Forebearance is being exchanged for carnal reactionism

▪️Preaching the Word is being exchanged for preaching sociopolitical stratagems

▪️Tenderness is being exchanged for callousness

▪️The ministry of Reconciliation is being exchanged for the ministry of condemnation

▪️Worldly separation is being exchanged for friendship with the same

▪️Willingness to show grace is being exchanged for zeal to retaliate

▪️The Kingdom of God is being exchanged for the Kingdom of men

The fervent love of Christ as expressed from the inner heart of his purported people is growing colder by the day.

This shouldn’t surprise us in the least, but it should most definitely cause us to implore him for preservation in the midst of apostasy, as well as foster in us an earnest desire for faith working through love, a desire to serve, and a drive to see the full fruit of the Spirit made tangibly manifest in us on a daily basis.

Questions in need of theologically grounded answers:

🇮🇱Why is the entire world having to continually focus on the happenings in Israel?

🇮🇱Why is the entire world coming against the state of Israel?

🇮🇱Why is there even a state of Israel in existence for the entire world to participate in the aforementioned to begin with?

🇮🇱What is the overarching theological significance for the existence of such a nation, and the geopolitical focus upon it?

Supersessionists,

▪️Why has God allowed the aforementioned geopolitical realities to capture the world’s attention on both a political and sociological level for no necessarily providential or prophetic reason whatsoever according to your theology?

▪️What’s further, are you able to explicate these realities without resorting to unfounded conspiracy theory? Additionally, even granting that the conspiracy theories are true for sake of argument

…why is God allowing these things to happen, and what is his prophetic or providential reasoning for their admittance into the political reality of our day?
