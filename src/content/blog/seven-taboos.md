## Introduction

In contemporary evangelical churches in the West, certain subjects are often avoided altogether due to their potentially controversial nature, for fear of ‘offending’ our fellow brother in Christ. This culture of political correctness often leads the Church to self-censor and evade necessary truths. Should Christians continue to conform to this PC culture, especially given that this PC culture is actually rooted in Marxism, designed to exploit the kindness and goodwill of Christians to silence them? Or should we instead pluck up the [courage](/courage) to confront and discuss these critical and controversial topics, and thereby motivate each other to live godly lives, eagerly awaiting Jesus’ imminent and glorious appearing (2 Timothy 4:8)? These are the seven key taboos that must be boldly reintroduced and emphasised in our teachings:

## 1\. Biblical Politics

The Church must reject the man-centred, atheistic, and materialistic worldviews of [leftist ideologies](/leftism-eng). Instead, we should teach and promote a biblical approach to politics that recognises free enterprise, a free market, and a conservative view of governance that minimises state control and emphasises individual responsibility. Leftist ideologies wreck individual lives through victimhood mentality; leftist ideologies wreck nations through race-to-the-bottom handouts and disincentivising hard work. Leftist ideologies metamorphoses into liberal, progress theologies that reject the authority of God’s Word.

## 2\. Power of the Holy Spirit

Many churches have embraced cessationism, mistakenly believing that the supernatural gifts of the Holy Spirit ceased with the apostolic age. Even in churches that do not espouse cessationism, the whole subject of the baptism of the Holy Spirit is avoided altogether in the name of pursuing “unity” in the church. Not only is this counter-productive, it actually goes against what the Bible says:

> For John truly baptised with water, but you shall be baptised with the Holy Spirit not many days from now.. But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be witnesses to Me .. to the end of the earth.
> 
> Acts 1:5,8

The time is ripe for the Church to be actively teaching a vibrant, experiential understanding of the Holy Spirit’s ongoing work. We need to openly discuss, embrace and practice the supernatural gifts of the Holy Spirit, given to us by God to build up the Church and to empower us for effective evangelism.

## 3\. Israel and Restoration Theology

The church must reject replacement theology, which erroneously suggests that the church has replaced Israel in God’s plan. Instead, it should embrace Restoration Theology, which acknowledges Israel’s ongoing biblical significance and God’s promises concerning its full physical and spiritual restoration. This perspective is crucial for the correct understanding of biblical prophecy and also for the correct interpretation of world events today in light of God’s faithfulness to His promises.

## 4\. The Second Coming and The Millennial Kingdom

Eschewing both amillennialism and post-millennialism, the Church should return to its roots (the beliefs of the original Early Church) and firmly hold to [dispensational pre-tribulation pre-millennialism](/eschatology), which underscores the imminence of the [rapture](/rapture)—when believers will meet Jesus in the air. This doctrine, and the belief in the subsequent [establishment of His Millennial Kingdom in Jerusalem](/throne-of-david), are essential for maintaining an active and eager anticipation of Christ’s return, enabling us to lead a holy life here and now.

## 5\. Spiritual Discipline of Fasting

[The discipline of fasting](/fasting), both personal and corporate, is often neglected in modern Christian practice. Regular and special fasting, along with [corporate fasting](/2026-fast) within the local church community, are practices that foster spiritual discipline and humility, preparing believers for deeper communion with God, helping us discern God’s will for us today, and to deepen our hunger for the glorious return of our Lord.

## 6\. Tithing and Generous Giving

A biblically rooted theology of stewardship should drive Christians to practice generosity through [tithing](/tithes) to their local churches and supporting missions. This commitment extends to “parental tithing,” where believers also ensure they do not neglect the financial support of their parents, reflecting the biblical command to honour one’s father and mother (Matthew 15:4-6).

## 7a. Family Order 1: The Primacy of Wives Submitting to Husbands

In the wake of rampant feminism making significant inroads into the Church, the Church on the whole has compromised with the principles of this world so much so that there is now a hesitancy to even discuss clear biblical instructions given in Ephesians 5:22, Colossians 3:18, and 1 Peter 3:1. Importantly, in each of these passages, the directive for wives to submit to their husbands is presented first, before the command is given to the husband to love their wives. This sequence is not incidental but fundamental to understanding God’s design for marriage. Following the wives’ submission, husbands are commanded to love their wives sacrificially, as Christ loved the Church and gave Himself for it. Regrettably, in modern discourse within many churches, this order is often misrepresented or inverted, suggesting that wives need only submit if their husbands first demonstrate Christ-like love. This interpretation is a serious misreading of Scripture. The Church must courageously promote and practice these countercultural teachings in their entirety, recognising that a wife’s submission paired with a husband’s Christ-like love exemplifies the Gospel in action. [By faithfully adhering to these biblical principles](/sarah-club), the Church can powerfully witness to the world through the example of godly families.

## 7b. Family Order 2: Disciplining of Children

The Biblical mandate is succinctly captured by the directives to “make disciples of your children” (Old Testament) and “make disciples of all nations” (New Testament). For thousands of years, Christians who have upheld the Bible as the infallible Word of God have relied on its wisdom and instructions for disciple-making. Yet, modern psychology often stands in opposition to biblical teachings on child-rearing, especially regarding discipline. The Church must actively discuss and encourage adherence to [biblical instructions on corporal punishment](/disciplining) and the holistic upbringing of children in Christian values, rejecting secular norms that conflict with Scripture and refusing to conform to the patterns of this world.

## 8\. Repentance for Historical Sins (Special for the Korean Church)

Specifically within the [Korean church](/ealing-yale), there is a need to address and repent for historical sins committed by the church against God during the Japanese occupation, including the grievous acts of kneeling before the Japanese Emperor and incorporating Emperor worship rituals even into regular Sunday worship services. Sadly, this topic is so avoided that most Korean Christians are not even aware of this historical fact. Humble acknowledgment of these historical sins and repenting for these past transgressions are essential for spiritual renewal and integrity.

## Conclusion

Reviving the discussion and teaching of these seven critical topics within the Church—and an additional specific issue within the Korean church—will not only lead to a deeper spiritual awakening but also restore the Church to its biblical foundations. This renewal is imperative for the church to effectively prepare as the holy Bride of Christ, eagerly waiting for her Bridegroom’s return.
