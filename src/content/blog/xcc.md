#### Xtreme Character Challenge: An adventure of Body, Mind, and Soul (October 10–13, 2024 @ Brecon Beacons, Wales)

I attended the Xtreme Character Challenge (XCC) in October 2024, held amidst the stunning landscapes of the Brecon Beacons in Wales. My decision to participate stemmed from a heartfelt recommendation by a respected friend from church. He had attended the XCC in Scotland this past May and spoke passionately about the profound connections he made, saying, “You’ll be amazed at how close you can become with 8–9 men in such a short time.”

Two weeks before the camp started, I decided to join and shared the information with my high school buddy, Colin. Coincidentally, he had been looking for something like this and signed up with me right away. Participants were divided into groups of ten and began contacting each other a few days prior. Preparing sleeping bags, tents, backpacks, and other gear made me feel like I was about to embark on a high school field trip.

Upon arrival, all participants were required to surrender all phones and electronic devices—even wristwatches were confiscated. Taking away the ability to keep track of time encouraged full immersion in the challenge. Simply being disconnected from society and eliminating the distractions of mobile phones for four days was meaningful in itself. For many participants—mostly fathers who are constantly under pressure to provide for their families—it definitely had a detoxing effect. However, this program offered something deeper than just a simple detox.

One of the mottos of this program is **BODY, MIND, SOUL**. Roughly speaking, they coincide with the three full days: on Friday, we faced physical challenges; on Saturday, mental challenges; and on Sunday, spiritual challenges.

To briefly explain the history of [XCC](https://www.xcc.org.uk) (4M UK): In the Netherlands, a Christian men’s extreme challenge camp known as the “Four Musketeers Ministry” had long been running and is now a household name among Dutch churches. In 2016, this concept was brought to the UK by James Ray. A former high school PE and camping teacher, he is now an ordained Anglican priest who leads the XCC full-time, personally guiding all camps 4–5 times a year. ([Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJpP1Zx8_H4) is a link to an interview where James explains how God called him to this ministry.)

James is truly a bundle of charisma—humorous and inspiring. He naturally makes men, regardless of age, want to follow him. I later heard that in 2019 they tried to develop leaders like James to run the XCC in his place, but the attempts failed. James’s charisma is a key factor in the success of XCC.

#### Friday: The Physical Challenge

At the crack of dawn on Friday, wake-up signals sounded, and each team of ten set off. All participants carried 15–20 kg backpacks—including tents, sleeping bags, and food rations—and marched onward. When darkness fell, we turned on headlamps and kept moving. Later, I found out that the course we walked from 6 a.m. to midnight is notoriously difficult and is used in the selection process for the British Special Air Service (SAS), known as the “VW” (Voluntary Withdrawal) course. The last section, where we had to clamber up a nearly vertical 100-meter cliff using both hands and feet in total darkness, was even more challenging than when I climbed to the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro 20 years ago.

What was even harder for many men was that the crew didn’t inform us of the entire course in advance but only told us the next 2–3 km section, one at a time. It didn’t bother me much, but I saw that this uncertainty of not knowing when the finish would be was a significant mental stress for some in our team.

The Brecon Beacons offered outstanding scenery. The weather during our stay was also good, with hardly any rain. Walking with my team members, we couldn’t help but marvel at the beautiful landscapes more than once. It naturally led to outbursts of praise. In particular, I had memorized Psalm 145 while preparing for this trip. With my team members’ permission, I recited it aloud atop a hill, and we all felt spiritually refreshed. “_All Your works shall praise You, O LORD; and Your saints shall bless You._”

#### Saturday: The Mental Challenge

On Saturday, we shifted gears and moved as a single unit. There was a clear switch during this day when the Gospel was presented multiple times. The focus was less on men helping each other—though that was helpful and necessary—and more on how we can have full access to our Maker and Father in heaven on account of what Jesus did on the cross. The climax of XCC was the “pilgrimage”: hiking up a hill to a cross at the summit and laying down at its foot a rock or stone that we had picked up at the bottom, representing our burdens in life. “Lord, I give you my body,” was my heartfelt prayer as I laid down my stone.

Without giving too much away, there was a satisfying ceremony and celebration awaiting us on Saturday night. We were all glad the hard part of the weekend was behind us and could truly savour the moment together.

#### Sunday: The Spiritual Challenge

On Sunday, we did church together as men. To borrow the words of my friend who recommended XCC to me, it was one of the “clearest expressions of what a church can be.” The whole 72-hour period had been refined to encourage men to be vulnerable to each other within the team. The fact that we all had just gone through a physically challenging experience together added to the camaraderie. In addition, the crew led by example on Friday by candidly sharing their past mistakes (mostly of not slowing down) and the resulting pain, hurt and destruction.

By Sunday afternoon, after our service in the woods, men were sharing intimate details with the team that they had never told another soul. Each time, we were instructed not to offer solutions but instead respond with, “Thank you for sharing.” This last sharing among the team and in the larger group was the highlight of the weekend for me. As my friend had said, I was amazed at how close one can become with 8–9 men in such a short time, and we all felt like we had gained at least a few men who truly accept each other and will be there to support us through hard times going forward.

> “The right hand of the LORD does valiantly! The right hand of the LORD is exalted! The right hand of the LORD does valiantly! **_I shall not die, but live!_** And declare the works of the LORD.”

#### Reflections

One common theme during the weekend was just how much things are stacked against men in society in general, but also within churches. Some men had shared the issues they were facing in their churches, only to encounter condemnation and cold shoulders. It is a shame that in today’s climate, men often have nowhere to go for true support. In that sense, ministries like XCC are sorely needed.

Many participants were returning for the second or third time, often bringing friends from their churches. I can see why. I, too, hope to take more men from my church and attend a future XCC together!

It’s impossible to fully articulate the experiences shared among the 110 participants and 30 volunteer staff during this four-day challenge. One thing is certain: just as my friend promised, our Team 325 of ten has become a close-knit group who will continue to stay in touch. The XCC was not just a physical endeavor but a profound journey of body, mind, and soul that has left a lasting impact on me.
