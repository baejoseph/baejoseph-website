Short answer: I will not be silenced by the opinions of the politically correct majority and their Overton Window.

Long answer: To teach my children that TDS (Trump Derangement Syndrome) is one of the most dangerous mind viruses of our times.

Longer answer: I’ve read somewhere that some people deliberately get tattoos to filter out those kind of people who might see them and avoid them. I’d like to think the MAGA hat would serve a similar purpose: to filter out those who would find it offensive because they are suffering from TDS and/or are leftists. And I don’t need such people in my life.
