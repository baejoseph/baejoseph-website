I made a wooden cross for street evangelism. A trip to the B&Q, buy 15x68x2400mm pine strip wood planks, and some nuts and bolts. Cut to length, drill some holes, and file down some notches:

It is easy to make a wooden cross that folds up. We made one for Joshua and for Jonathan too:

We carry the cross as a visible sign when we go out to the streets:

**Update:** a year on, my son Joshua wrote about what it’s like to carry this cross every week — [The Best Gift in the World](/best-gift/).
