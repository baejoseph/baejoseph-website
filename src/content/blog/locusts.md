In the realm of wisdom literature, the Bible often presents profound insights through simple observations. “There are four things which are little on the earth, but they are exceedingly wise”—thus begins the Wisdom of Agur in Proverbs 30. Agur invites us to glean wisdom from the behaviour of small creatures. The focal verse for our discussion is Proverbs 30:27:

> “The locusts have no king,  
> Yet they all advance in ranks.”
> 
> Proverbs 30:27

This succinct verse challenges the Left’s reliance on government, or “king”, in orchestrating societal matters, especially in the context of wealth redistribution and aid administration.

### The Leftist’s Obsession with Government Intervention

Leftist ideologies invariably advocate for the use of the government mechanisms to redistribute wealth and provide aid to the less fortunate. While aiming to create a more “equitable” society, this approach is marred by two critical flaws: the forced nature of government intervention and its inherent inefficiency.

Firstly, government intervention in wealth redistribution necessarily involves an element of force. Taxes are levied under the threat of violence and legal consequences. This enforced participation in the name of welfare starkly contrasts with the Biblical endorsement of voluntary charity, which is motivated by empathy and compassion. Such coercion in the guise of aid not only undermines the free will and individual moral choice that are central to Biblical teachings but also risks paving the way towards totalitarianism. When the government assumes the role of enforcing charity, it not only inhibits the individual’s right to choose generosity, but also fosters a reliance and dependency mentality in recipients. Most damagingly, this forced redistribution disincentivises hard work in the general population, which in turn will lead to a cycle of entitlement and societal degradation. It’s the whole reason why socialism never works.

Secondly, the efficacy of government-run programs frequently falls short of expectations. Their levels of bureaucracy and the disconnect from local contexts hinder governmental bodies from administering aid effectively. This results in a one-size-fits-all approach, which fails to address the specific needs of different communities and individuals. Moreover, government policies can inadvertently create counterproductive incentives, undermining the very welfare they aim to improve. A notable example is the [“man in the house” rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aid_to_Families_with_Dependent_Children) implemented in the 1960s for African American single mothers. This policy incentivised and thus unintentionally promoted single-parent families, contributing to the epidemic of fatherlessness in the Black community—from under 30% in 1950 to over 75% by 1990, thus having a profound and detrimental impact on the demographic.

### The Locusts’ Wisdom: Grassroots, Self-Organised Acts of Charity

Proverbs 30:27 presents an alternative model, exemplified by the orderly swarming of locusts without a central authority. When individuals or smaller community groups come together voluntarily to address the societal needs that they can observe, they bring with them a deeper understanding of the local context and a personal commitment to the cause. This decentralised approach not only ensures more effective and targeted aid but also fosters a stronger sense of community.

### Technological Parallel: Swarming Algorithms

Interestingly, this concept finds resonance in cutting-edge technological advancements, notably in swarming algorithms in drone technology. These algorithms, inspired by natural swarms like locusts, operate without centralised control. Instead, each drone adjusts its behaviour based on its nearest neighbours, resulting in efficient, adaptable formations achieved through decentralised interactions.

### The Necessity of Sharing in Society

At this point in the essay, it is crucial to acknowledge the dangers of a society that shuns sharing altogether. A strictly free-market “every man for himself” mentality, underpinned by the belief that a person deserves to keep all their earnings without a duty to share, risks creating a fragmented, indifferent society, eroding the sense of community and leading to social unrest. We need to find a balance between personal achievement and communal responsibility, steering clear of the extremes of government-enforced redistribution and total non-sharing.

### Biblical Teaching on Equality

The Bible does not overlook the need for “equality” among believers in the Household of God. In 2 Corinthians 8:1-15, Paul states that those with surplus should help those in need, not as an imposition but as a reflection of what Christ has done for us (“That though He was rich, yet for your sakes He became poor, that you through His poverty might become rich” v9). This model of voluntary, community-driven support, where sharing of resources is motivated not by compulsion but by a shared sense of compassion underscores the value of generosity as a reflection of Christ’s love.

## Conclusion

Reflecting on the wisdom of Proverbs, we have explored the efficacy of decentralised, grassroots approaches over government-led interventions in addressing societal needs. This model, rooted in voluntary participation and local understanding, not only aligns with Biblical teachings of charity and the core principles of freedom and personal responsibility but also ensures a more effective, empathetic, and cohesive society. When not giving or sharing at all is not a viable option, embracing this wisdom of voluntary, grassroots giving can lead to more harmonious and effective community living, honouring the Biblical teachings of charity and freedom.
