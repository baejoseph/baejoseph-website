It was great to attend the beautiful wedding service and reception afterwards! The service was such a blessing, with a clear declaration of the Gospel (by Steve of WEC) and an excellent selection of Spirit-filled hymns and songs of blessing. May God bless the new family in their exciting adventure together!

Note how my wife and I both have lost so much weight, right after our 21-day fast at the beginning of the year; so many people were asking why we lost so much weight [🥰](https://emojipedia.org/smiling-face-with-hearts/)
