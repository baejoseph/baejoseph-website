South Korea is grappling with an existential crisis: its plummeting fertility rate. This issue has been widely acknowledged both within and outside the country, with Western media paying particular attention in recent years. The depth of the crisis, coupled with the failure of government incentives to reverse the trend, is disheartening. The birth rate, which stood at over six children per woman in the 1960s, has now dropped to an alarmingly low figure. Despite the injection of significant financial resources, no policy has succeeded in addressing the root causes of this demographic decline. However, history and comparative examples suggest a solution is possible—if the political will exists to implement it.

The key to reversing this trend lies in fundamentally altering the social status of childbearing among women. Evidence is abundantly clear: financial incentives are simply not as compelling for women as the social prestige attached to motherhood. The Mongolian model provides an inspiring blueprint. Recognizing the need for population growth, Mongolia instituted the “Order of Mother Heroine” awards in 1957. These honors celebrate mothers who raise multiple children, with First-Class awards for mothers of six or more children and Second-Class awards for those with four to five children. In 2022 alone, over 12,500 mothers received these honors.

The monetary component of these awards is minimal—$60 for First-Class and $30 for Second-Class—but the social significance is profound. These awards are ceremoniously bestowed, and even Mongolian ambassadors distribute them to expatriates. The results are clear: Mongolia boasts one of the highest fertility rates outside of Africa, significantly outpacing its regional neighbors. The success of this policy underscores that the heart of the issue is not financial but cultural.

For South Korea, adopting such measures is a start, but it is unlikely to be enough. A bolder approach is necessary, given the severity of the crisis. South Korea’s unique sociopolitical landscape, which includes mandatory military service for men, provides a potential framework for transformative change. The proposal is radical: extend voting rights only to men who have completed their national service and to women who have borne at least three children in wedlock. Such a policy would instantly elevate the social status of motherhood, providing a powerful incentive for women to prioritize childbearing. This measure would not only address the fertility crisis but also reinforce the cultural emphasis on family and societal contribution.

Critics may argue that such a proposal is politically infeasible, and indeed, it would face significant resistance. Decades of leftist influence, which has feminized both society and the church, have entrenched cultural norms that resist drastic measures. Nonetheless, desperate times call for desperate solutions. South Korea’s demographic situation is not merely a policy challenge but a national emergency. Without courageous leadership willing to confront this reality head-on, the nation risks irreversible decline.

To implement such transformative policies, South Korea needs a visionary leader—a figure who can articulate the gravity of the situation and galvanize public support for unconventional solutions. This leader must inspire South Koreans to reclaim their future by embracing bold reforms. If the nation can overcome its ideological inertia and cultural resistance, it may yet solve its fertility crisis and secure its future. The stakes are too high to settle for half-measures or incremental changes. South Korea’s survival depends on decisive action.
