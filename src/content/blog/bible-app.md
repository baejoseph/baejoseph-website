One of the highlight of 2025 has been the founding of [JD Fortress AI Ltd](https://jdfortress.com) with my good friend (and brother in Christ!) from church, Dev. Together, we share a deep love for God’s Word in these tumultuous times—given to us as “a lamp to our feet and a light to our path” (Psalm 119:105)—and the promise that those who seek Him will find Him.

Out of that conviction, we launched [Fortress Labs](https://jdfortress.com/labs): our experimental workshop inside JD Fortress AI Ltd, where we build tools that first serve the needs of everyday people, then shine as examples of what our fortress-grade, offline AI can do for businesses that refuse to gamble with their data.

Today we are delighted to release a new fruit of Fortress Labs: a simple, distraction-free [Bible web-app](https://bible.jdfortress.com).

We built it for ourselves first. Bookmark it. Then, whenever you have five minutes to spare, or before you go to sleep, **just open it**: no login, no cookies, no fuss. **Today’s four passages** from [Robert Murray M’Cheyne’s plan](/mccheyne) **appear instantly in the majestic [New King James Version](/nkjv)**. Five minutes morning and evening now bookend our days in Scripture instead of doom-scrolling on 𝕏 . Experience the living Word shaping your thoughts, your dreams, your lives.

Like [the sons of Issachar](/heroics) who “understood the times and knew what Israel ought to do” (1 Chronicles 12:32), we need God’s voice cutting through the noise. This app removes every barrier so we can redeem those scattered moments and hide His Word in our hearts.

At JD Fortress AI, Dev and I spend our evenings and weekends deploying secure, on-premises LLMs and bulletproof RAG pipelines that keep sensitive business data locked inside a fortress no cloud can breach. Fortress Labs simply asks: how can the same privacy-first, local-first principles also be leveraged to serve the needs of everyday people like you and me?

The app is [live](https://bible.jdfortress.com) now. No tracking. Just Scripture, waiting.
