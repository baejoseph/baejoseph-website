Yesterday I finally completed [the Murph challenge](/murph) for the first time—100 pull-ups, 200 push-ups, 300 squats, with a one-mile run before and after, all done wearing a 9kg weighted vest. Time: 1 hour 20 minutes, with plenty of rest breaks along the way.

A few months ago, finishing the full Murph felt like a pipe dream. The half-Murph was already humbling enough when I started. But I've been doing the half every morning since then, and yesterday the investment paid off. The gap between who I was and who I am physically is not subtle—I feel it in everything I do. Stronger, more capable, more confident. That's a bonus I wasn't expecting.

Lord, thank You.

Next goal: the full Murph in under one hour.
