There is a moment in every civilisation's story when the sins it refused to name come back to name themselves. England has reached that moment.

I have been sitting with Psalm 101 this week, turning it over, reading it the way you read something that cuts rather than comforts. David wrote it as a covenant of personal holiness-a king's declaration of what he would not permit to enter his house, his sight, his court. And then I read Rupert Lowe's inquiry statement, and I understood why David wrote it at all. Because there are things so perverse, so rotted through, that the only faithful response is to name them and refuse them entirely.

> "I will set nothing wicked before my eyes; I hate the work of those who fall away; it shall not cling to me. A perverse heart shall depart from me; I will not know wickedness."
>
> Psalm 101:3-4 (NKJV)

### What the Inquiry Has Uncovered

On 23 February 2026, Rupert Lowe MP released a formal statement from the Pakistani Muslim Rape Gang Inquiry. The panel-Lowe, Esther McVey, barrister Graham Smith, and survivor advocate Sammy Woodhouse-heard testimony from a survivor whose account I will not sanitise.

![Statement from the Rape Gang Inquiry, signed by Rupert Lowe MP, Esther McVey MP, Graham Smith Barrister, and Sammy Woodhouse](/assets/rape-gang-inquiry-statement.jpg)

She was first raped at age 12. Multiple times per day, for years. The rapes were filmed and used as blackmail. Police officers were not merely absent-some were active perpetrators. Money changed hands openly. Police vehicles were used to traffic her to abuse events the perpetrators called "cop nights." She witnessed the murder of at least three girls, one killed as punishment for speaking to authorities.

The post reached 26 million views in under 48 hours. Lowe wrote: "This is an organised criminal network of rape and slavery. It is so much worse than people realise." He is right. This is worse in scale, duration, and institutional depth than anything the Epstein scandal exposed. And it has been suppressed-systematically, deliberately-for decades.

I don't want to give you measured commentary. I want to tell you how I actually responded when I read this.

I felt something close to moral vertigo. When the police are among the rapists and murderers, where do you go? Who do you call? If the institutions of justice are themselves instruments of evil, what is left? The mainstream British media is not reporting this honestly-they know that full transparency would trigger a revolt, and they are terrified of that revolt. So they manage the story. They meter it out. They protect the guilty.

I am not interested in managing this story.

### The Governing Class Has Blood on Its Hands

What we are looking at is not a failure of bureaucratic coordination. It is a deliberate, ideologically motivated cover-up—and its roots go back not merely to Blair but to [the Fabian Society](/fabian/) that formed him: 140 years of patient, deliberate institutional capture.

New Labour's project required [mass immigration](/multiculturalism/). Not for economic reasons—that was the public justification—but for cultural transformation: to remake Britain's demographic character so fundamentally that the old England could never reassert itself. Pakistani Muslim communities were imported by the hundreds of thousands. And when those communities began producing rape gangs on an industrial scale in Rochdale, Rotherham, Telford, Oxford, and dozens of other towns, the same ideological machine that had imported them could not permit the reckoning. To name the rape gangs was to name the Fabian programme's catastrophic failure. So they named the people who named them instead: racists, Islamophobes, far-right agitators.

Girls were sacrificed on the altar of [multicultural ideology](/multiculturalism/). That is not hyperbole. That is what happened.

The officers who raised the alarm were disciplined. The politicians who asked questions were smeared. And Rupert Lowe-who had the [courage](/courage/) to push for a real inquiry-was targeted by Nigel Farage and others within his own political orbit, moved to sideline him. Rupert Lowe is a patriot. The ones who silenced him are traitors. I will not soften that word. It is the correct one.

### The Sword Was Sheathed When It Should Have Swung

This is not merely a political crisis. It is a moral and spiritual one. And the Bible is unambiguous about what governments are for.

> "For he is God's minister to you for good. But if you do evil, be afraid; for he does not bear the sword in vain; for he is God's minister, an avenger who executes wrath on him who practices evil."
>
> [Romans 13](/biblical-political-vision/):4 (NKJV)

The state bears the sword. That is not a metaphor-it is the divine warrant for government authority, established in the Noahic covenant given to all humanity:

> "Whoever sheds man's blood, by man his blood shall be shed; for in the image of God He made man."
>
> Genesis 9:6 (NKJV)

Every time I raise the death penalty, someone objects: "Who are you to play God?" That objection is theologically illiterate. When a government executes a murderer, it is not playing God-it is *obeying* God. The men who raped, filmed, trafficked, tortured, and murdered these girls should be executed. Not imprisoned, not rehabilitated. The sword of the state, wielded rightly under God's authority, should fall on them. To refuse that is not mercy. It is an inversion of the moral order God himself established.

England has been inverting it for thirty years.

> "He who justifies the wicked, and he who condemns the just, both of them alike are an abomination to the Lᴏʀᴅ."
>
> Proverbs 17:15 (NKJV)

An abomination. Not a mistake, not a tragedy-an abomination. The British government has justified the wicked and condemned the just for a generation. And a nation that sacrifices its children to the idol of multicultural ideology does not escape the sight of the Lᴏʀᴅ.

### There Is No Coexistence

I want to say something plainly that most commentators won't say: peaceful coexistence with Islam in England is no longer a viable proposition. Not after this. Not given what has been done, what has been covered up, and what the response of Muslim community leadership has overwhelmingly been-silence, deflection, and accusations of racism against anyone who dares name what happened.

The vision below does not strike me as extreme given what I now know. It strikes me as justice.

![From the English Channel to the North Sea, Make England Islam-Free](/assets/islam-free-england.jpg)

I wrote about the [halal slaughter scandal](/halal/) and how it illustrates the incompatibility of Islamic practice with English law and English conscience. The rape gang scandal is not a separate category of problem-it is the same problem at a different order of magnitude. The conditions for peaceful Muslim presence in England were not destroyed by the English. They were destroyed by the gangs, and by the governing class that protected them.

### Do Not Look Away

The survivor who testified before Lowe's panel waited years to be believed. Positive NRM grounds in 2018-not told until 2021. Conclusive grounds in 2023. Five years of bureaucratic delay while her abusers walked free. That is not a system failure. That is a system working as designed.

The Lᴏʀᴅ sees every one of those years. He sees every crime committed in the darkness of those "red rooms." He sees every official who chose career over justice, every officer who chose complicity over duty, every editor who chose access over truth.

England is not experiencing a political crisis. It is experiencing a [reckoning](/restore/) that thirty years of cowardice have made inevitable. The ground is shifting. Twenty-six million people read that statement in two days. The cover cannot hold.

The question now is whether England will find the [courage](/courage/) to do what righteousness demands-full transparency, full prosecution, capital punishment for the guilty, and unflinching accountability for every member of the institutional class that enabled this-or whether it will retreat once more behind the comfort of managed silence.

I am not interested in managed silence. Name it. Say it plainly. Stand behind every Rupert Lowe who is willing to drag this into the light.

The day of reckoning England avoided for thirty years has arrived. The question is whether we will be faithful to it.
