*“Elam will be shattered before their foes; I will bring the four winds from the four quarters of the heavens and scatter them to the four winds.”* — Jeremiah 49:36

On 28 February 2026, a joint United States–Israel precision operation — codenamed **Epic Fury** — decapitated the leadership of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Forty-seven years of clerical tyranny, exported terrorism, and apocalyptic posturing ended not with a grinding ground war but with surgical, technology-enabled strikes of breathtaking precision.

[I called this in June 2025](/iran/). I wrote that a regime change in Iran was not only plausible — it was **prophetically necessary**. I said the Ayatollahs had to go before Ezekiel 38 could unfold. And here we are.

Let me try to process what this means — for Iran, for America, for prophecy, and for the Church.

### For the People of Iran

Iranians all over the world are celebrating. Let that sink in. Not just dissidents in exile — Iranians everywhere, openly, joyfully. This is not a people mourning their leadership. This is a people who have been held hostage for nearly half a century, and who are finally breathing free air.

The regime that murdered tens of thousands of its own citizens — many of them gunned down by mercenary forces imported from abroad, because Persian soldiers refused to shoot their own people — is gone. The regime that funded Hamas, armed Hezbollah, bankrolled the Houthis, and turned Iran’s young generation into collateral for an apocalyptic theocratic dream is gone.

Even the [mainstream media](/sober/) — the press that viscerally hates Donald Trump — is having to cover this. There is no way to spin it. The Islamic Republic is finished.

May the people of Iran take back their country and their freedom. May Iranian patriots from every corner of the diaspora pour back into that beautiful, ancient nation and help rebuild it. Persia is one of the great civilisations of human history. She deserves better than mullahs with blood on their hands.

And I will say this quietly but sincerely: I have been thinking since January that a **family holiday in Iran this summer** might actually be on the cards. What an extraordinary sentence to write. What an extraordinary time to be alive.

### Thank God — He Heard the Prayers

Before anything else, let us acknowledge who this victory truly belongs to.

The Christians of Iran — the underground church, the house churches that have grown explosively under persecution — have been fasting and praying for decades. They prayed for their nation. They prayed under threat of imprisonment, torture, and death. God heard them.

**Praise God.** This is what answered prayer looks like on a geopolitical scale. Do not let the [political commentary](/vivek-en/) crowd out the theological reality: the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob moves in history. He always has. He always will.

### On Donald J. Trump

Some of the supposed character “flaws” of Donald Trump are precisely those qualities needed to be a courageous and bold global leader. [I have written about this before.](/courage/) He is not beholden to the castrated political and academic classes, so he simply acts out of conviction. The world owes him a significant debt.

What is dawning on me slowly — and I think on many others — is that perhaps no American leader since the dawn of modern warfare actually knew what to do with the military, or how to use it appropriately and effectively, with minimal cost and minimal casualty. Not one. Which is why the last eighty years have been one blundering disaster after another, punctuated by a few accidentally brilliant moments — usually achieved *in spite of*, not *because of*, brilliant strategic leadership.

But Trump has done something remarkable. As a long-time America First anti-war isolationist, I never thought I would write these words: **I think Trump has managed to crack open the sclerotic, necrotic, petrified template for managing bad actors abroad — and write a new script.**

I am looking forward to seeing if this one has a happy ending. And by God, I think it might.

### Why the Forever Wars Were Such a Catastrophe

Why the actual hell did we sacrifice so many great American men to the grinding forever wars of Iraq and Afghanistan — when we could have done *this* the whole time?

Part of the answer is technology. We did not have the drone capability we have today. GPS and satellite imagery were far less accurate. Precision strikes of this nature were simply impossible twenty years ago. People genuinely do not appreciate how far military technology has come, and how profoundly it changes the calculus of force.

But part of the answer is darker: the forever wars were, at least in part, a machinery for laundering vast sums to the defence-contractor ecosystem in the DC–Virginia–Maryland corridor. Wars that were never meant to be won. Wars that were meant to *continue*.

Trump’s approach is different. The objective is to *win* — quickly, decisively, and with minimal American blood. Turns out wars are a lot simpler when that is actually the goal.

### On Bluffing and Credibility

One thing that cannot be said about this President is that he bluffs.

Maduro thought Trump was bluffing. He found out. The Ayatollah thought Trump was bluffing. He found out.

Another thing that cannot be said is that Trump’s first instinct is violence. Maduro was offered exile with a comfortable payday. He declined. The Ayatollah was offered a genuine path to civilian nuclear power in exchange for surrendering his weapons programme and ballistic missile development. He declined.

The lesson for every bad actor on earth is simple: **if Donald Trump says “unless you do this, I’m coming to get you” — he means it.** That is not a bad reputation to have on the world stage. In fact, it is the only reputation that makes deterrence work.

### Bible Prophecy: The Sequence Is Unfolding

Now we must not forget the prophetic angle — because I believe this is the most important lens through which to view these events.

[I have written extensively on this](/eschatology/). But let me lay out what I believe the sequence looks like:

**👉🏼 The Aftermath**

- Iran’s regime collapses—Hezbollah, the Houthis, and Hamas lose their patron — funding dries up, momentum collapses—A power vacuum opens across the Shia crescent—Sunni Arab nations — Saudi Arabia, the UAE — move closer to Israel—A temporary, deceptive peace emerges

**💥 The Prophetic Sequence**

- **Iran is struck** — Nuclear and military infrastructure destroyed *(Jeremiah 49:35–36)*
- **Iran’s regime falls** — The Ayatollah loses control, leadership unravels *(Jeremiah 49:38)*
- **Proxies weaken** — Terror networks lose funding and weapons
- **Sunni nations align with Israel** — A new wave of Abraham Accords
- **A false peace rises** — Israel feels secure *(Ezekiel 38:8; 1 Thessalonians 5:3)*
- **The Rapture** — The Church is removed before the great tribulation *(2 Thessalonians 2:6–7)*
- **The Ezekiel 38 invasion begins** — Russia, Turkey, and a post-regime Persia attack a prosperous Israel
- **God intervenes supernaturally** — With earthquake, hail, fire, and confusion among the invaders *(Ezekiel 38:19–22)*

The Church needs to wake up. We are living through the last days. The pieces are not merely falling into place — they are *snapping* into place, one by one, with extraordinary speed.

[The Rapture is not a fairy tale — it is the next event on the prophetic calendar.](/rapture/) The question is not whether these things are unfolding. They are. The real question is: **are you ready?**

[Repent and believe](/allegiance/) in the Lord Jesus Christ. *Time is short.*

*God is not surprised by Operation Epic Fury. He ordained it before the foundation of the world. What a privilege to be alive to witness it.*
