Here’s the short, unapologetic vision of who we are and what we’re about.

We wake up every morning whispering, “Perhaps today,” because we’re [pre-trib](/rapture), [pre-mill](/labels), and pre-excited for the trumpet. “In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye… we shall be changed” (1 Corinthians 15:52). That **Blessed Hope** keeps the grin on our faces and the spring in our step.

**Our one allegiance**? [King Jesus](/allegiance)—the Lion of Judah who died, was buried, and [rose again](/bayes) exactly “[according to the Scriptures](/evangelism)” (1 Corinthians 15:3-4).

**Our playbook**? The 66 books alone. [Daily McCheyne reading](/bible-app), family devotions, Scripture memory on repeat. We’re not just hearers; we’re doers: rejoice always, pray without ceasing, give thanks in everything (1 Thessalonians 5:16-18).

**Our rhythm**? [Early mornings](/week), [Murph workouts](/murph), Monday fasting, first-three-days-of-the-month fasting, 21-day January [reset](/fasting). Bodies are useful slaves, not tyrants.

**Our hates** (yes, perfect hatred is allowed—see Psalm 139:22)?  
The BBC, [mainstream everything](/sober), [climate hysteria](/climate), globalism, [multiculturalism myths](/multiculturalism), [witchcraft](/tor), Islam, and every flavour of [Leftism](/leftism-eng)—[socialism](/starve), [Marxism](/3-men-room), CRT, queer theory, [Christian](/keller-eng) [progressivism](/propitiation). We spot it, rebuke it, reject it.

**Our loves**?  
Biblical hierarchy (husband → [wife](/submit) → [kids](/rod)); unashamed [masculine strength](/heroics); speaking the truth in love [without a single apology](/courage); the USA and everything its Founding Fathers stood for; [Trump](/maga-hat) and [the MAGA agenda](/closure); and defending the Name above every name—[firmly correcting anyone who dares misuse it in our hearing](/name-of-jesus).

We [tithe](/tithes) to the church, “parent-tithe” to honour mum and dad, and we train our children to [confess Christ boldly](/best-gift) because “whoever confesses Me before men, him I will also confess before My Father who is in heaven” (Matthew 10:32 NKJV).

In short: we live ready, singing, disciplined, grateful, and expectant—because our King is coming [quickly](/will) to [rule from Jerusalem](/throne-of-david) for a thousand glorious years.

Maranatha!
