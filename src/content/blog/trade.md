#### A meditation on 2 Chronicles chapter 1

The young king did not get rich by prayer alone. He built immense wealth by _**trade**_.

> Also the king made silver and gold as common in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedars as abundant as the sycamores which are in the lowland.
> 
> 2 Chronicles 1:15

Here’s the exact mechanism Scripture records (2 Chronicles 1:14-17):

1.  **International trade** was the engine  
    _“And Solomon had horses imported from Egypt and Keveh.. they exported them to all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Syria.”_  
    He bought horses and chariots cheap in Egypt and sold them at full market price to the kings of the Hittites and Syria. Generational wealth has always flowed across borders.
2.  He had **a skilled team** of salespeople  
    _“the king’s merchants bought them in Keveh at the current price.. thus, through their agents, they exported..”_  
    “The king’s merchants” were his professional sales force. No revenue without a skilled team that can close.
3.  He dominated **the key commodity** of his era  
    Horses and chariots = mobility + military power. Find today’s equivalent and own the supply chain.
4.  He mastered **pricing**  
    _“They also acquired and imported from Egypt a chariot for **six hundred shekels of silver**, and a horse for **one hundred and fifty**..”_  
    Buy low in Egypt, sell high in Syria. Margin is the difference between survival and abundance.
5.  He built **logistics** first  
    _“he had one thousand four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem”_  
    Chariot cities, stationed troops, secured routes—scalable infrastructure before the big volumes ever moved.
6.  He never forgot **force**  
    **“And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen”**  
    The same chariots that made him rich protected the wealth. Security is non-negotiable.

Solomon asked for wisdom. God gave him wisdom—and because he traded with it, riches followed.

> “The plans of the diligent lead surely to plenty.”
> 
> Proverbs 21:5

2025 application for the disciple:  
**_Trade wisely, build teams, master the key commodity, control pricing, secure logistics, protect the gains._**

Just remember the guardrail:

> “The love of money is a root of all kinds of evil.”
> 
> 1 Timothy 6:10

May we pursue wealth as a servant of the Kingdom, never as its master.
