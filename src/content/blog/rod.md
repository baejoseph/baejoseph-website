For thousands of years, Christians who have upheld the Bible as the infallible Word of God have relied on its wisdom and instructions for raising children in the home. Proverbs 13:24 declares, _“He who spares his rod hates his son, but he who loves him disciplines him promptly.”_ Because the underlying Hebrew grammar lacks a future tense, the verse can also be rendered as, _“He who spares his rod will come to hate his son.”_ This rendering, fully consistent with the original Hebrew, highlights the causal relationship between a failure to discipline and the eventual anger and hatred that develop in the parent. Discipline, when administered lovingly and consistently, safeguards both the parent and the child from devastating spiritual and emotional consequences.

### On the propitiatory function of physical discipline

In ancient times, the concept of propitiation—the appeasement of anger—was well understood. Paul describes Christ’s sacrifice as the ultimate propitiation (Romans 3:25), satisfying the divine anger that resulted from human sin. Similarly, sin within familial relationships, particularly disobedience from children, provokes anger in parents, whether consciously acknowledged or not. This anger, if left unchecked, accumulates like a poison over months and years, creating bitterness and alienation. Proverbs 13:24 offers a divine antidote: discipline.

Biblical discipline, particularly the use of the rod, is not an act of anger but of preemptive love. Parents who discipline their children promptly and appropriately neutralize the buildup of anger. Striking a child in anger is explicitly condemned; instead, godly correction should occur before emotions escalate. Parents who heed this command will find that they are not plagued by the resentment and bitterness that accumulates in those who reject God’s wisdom. In contrast, modern “discipline” methods—timeouts or grounding children while allowing them to indulge in distractions like video games—fail to address the heart of the issue. Meanwhile, the parents’ unresolved anger often manifests as verbal abuse, inflicting deeper emotional wounds.

### History of Church’s rejection of the Bible and the consequences

The rejection of physical discipline has roots in Enlightenment-era humanism. Thinkers like Rousseau, with their atheistic and anti-Biblical agendas, left their indelible marks on child psychology in the 19th century. Tragically, the Western Church was successfully swayed by this humanist ideology during the 20th century, choosing to heed the worldly wisdom over God’s clear instruction. The feminization of both society and the Church meant that the idea of corporal punishment for our children seemed barbaric and totally unfit for the sophistication of the modern world. Through sheer human pride, the Church collectively declared: “We know better than the Bible.” As a result, parents started raising a generation of children without the rod, with catastrophic consequences.

Within two generations, British church attendance plummeted from over 90% to less than 5%. Christian parents, following the advice of humanist academia instead of Scripture, failed to pass on their faith to the next generation. Beyond the spiritual collapse, society is now reaping a harvest of unprecedented psychological and emotional dysfunction. Children raised without proper discipline and exposed to unspoken anger of their parents, grow up to wreak havoc in society and get married only to perpetuate cycles of unresolved emotional brokenness into the next generation.

### How to do disciplining and conclusion

The Bible is clear regarding the intensity and purpose of discipline. Proverbs 23:13-14 prescribes corporal punishment with **a high enough intensity to cause a fear of death in the child**: _“Do not withhold correction from a child, for if you beat him with a rod, he will not die. You shall beat him with a rod, and deliver his soul from hell.”_ Such correction may seem harsh to our 21st century Western sensibilities, but the Bible clearly states that it is not abusive but redemptive, aimed at saving the child’s soul from certain destruction.

The modern consensus on child-rearing, rooted in rebellion against God’s Word, must be rejected. The Church must boldly return to Scripture, spitting in the face of worldly wisdom and proclaiming the authority of God. Biblical discipline, grounded in love and obedience to God, is vital for the spiritual and emotional well-being of both parent and child. Let us heed His wisdom and honour Him in all things, for His Word is always true.
