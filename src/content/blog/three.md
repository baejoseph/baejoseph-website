There are three distinct categories for ordering the life of a Christian. Believers striving to live in obedience to God’s Word, guided by the Holy Spirit, need to navigate between three key areas when ordering their thoughts, words, and actions:

1.  The church realm, where we focus on [preaching the gospel](/evangelism) and making disciples of all nations.
2.  The civic realm, where Christians organise to support the lesser of evils to curb the world’s free-fall corruption and [opposing communism](/leftism-eng) in every sphere of our lives.
3.  The eternal realm, where we [eagerly wait for](/end3) Jesus’ [glorious appearing](/rapture), the Millennium Kingdom, and the final establishment of New Heavens, New Earth, and the New Jerusalem.

While we focus our lives on being faithful in the first two realms, we must not lose sight of the third realm, in that true justice will be realised in this world only upon Jesus’ glorious return when he will finally establish [the Millennial Kingdom](/throne-of-david) and rule the whole world with a rod of iron. Personally, I am convinced that King Jesus will appoint me to be in the elite squad to tour the world and annihilate all remnants of communism in the His name. The thought of ruling the world together with Him for one thousand years during the Messianic Kingdom really excites me.

But until the Second Coming, the Bible clearly tells us that the world will grow increasingly wicked, with people loving themselves, money, and pleasure. While we do our utmost in preaching the Gospel, making disciples and pushing back against the Left, we must remember that this world cannot be restored by mere human effort. Unfortunately, many believers and church leaders hold to a amillennial or post-millennial eschatology and believe that we can transform this world in Jesus’s name before his Second Coming. But this is not Biblical Christianity. Trying to establish the millennial kingdom (utopia) by their own effort (the technical term is to “immanentise the eschaton”), these Christians are functionally no different than the followers of Leftism/Marxism/Gnosticism.

As Christians, we must focus on preaching the gospel, supporting righteous governance, boldly pushing back against leftism in all its forms, all the while not forgetting to eagerly wait for the glorious appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ. We must remember that justice will be realised on the earth only after He establishes His Millennial Kingdom. Until then, let us  rise, [speak the truth](/seven-taboos), & preach the gospel, knowing that our ultimate hope lies not in this world, but in the glorious future promised by our Savior. [Maranatha](/end3)! Even so, come Lord Jesus!
