I genuinely like Vivek Ramaswamy—the 2024 Republican presidential candidate. I’ve been watching him closely since March of this year. At first I was sceptical: *a Hindu president of the United States? Really?* But the more I watched, the more I thought—this man could actually do it. And I found myself understanding something I never quite grasped back in 2007–2008.

I was at Yale then, surrounded by young people losing their minds over Barack Obama. I watched with curiosity, unable to understand why they were so emotionally electrified by a candidate. Fifteen years later, watching Vivek, I finally get it. *If a man like this could become the next president of the United States*—the thought alone puts a smile on my face.

Here’s why I’m a fan:

**He’s elite without the disease.** Vivek has walked every corridor of prestige American society has to offer—and yet he hasn’t caught Trump Derangement Syndrome. On the contrary, he loves Trump the way I do. He even correctly diagnoses TDS as a kind of psychiatric illness afflicting roughly 30% of the American population. That clarity of perception, coming from someone of his pedigree, is remarkable.

**He reframes the political divide.** Most people see it as left vs. right. Vivek sees it differently: approximately 20% of the country—the radical Marxist left—is actively working against America, and the remaining 80% still love it. That framing is devastatingly accurate. It’s reminiscent of what South Korea’s conservatives have been saying about the anti-state forces—communist sympathisers and corrupt factions—who have been fighting against patriots like President Yoon and the justice system.

**He names the spiritual vacuum.** Young people today have abandoned the church and are wandering without purpose, identity, or meaning. That vacuum isn’t staying empty—it’s being filled by radical left activism: Critical Race Theory, climate cultism, gender ideology. Vivek identifies this with precision. But he doesn’t stop there. He levels a critique at the right as well: *you’re only good at saying what you’re against.* Anti-communism, anti-left—fine, but where’s the vision? Vivek says he found his in the Declaration of Independence and the founding fathers of 1776: faith, patriotism, hard work, excellence, family. A revival of those values. Specific, grounded, and compelling.

**He declared war on the administrative state.** Vivek—a Yale Law graduate—has the legal framework to back it up. He’s proposed firing 50% of federal bureaucrats in year one, 75% by year two. He wants to shut down the FBI and the Department of Education entirely—institutions so compromised they’re beyond repair. He notes that legal challenges will come, but with a 6–3 conservative Supreme Court (thanks, in no small part, to Trump), he’s confident. This is the kind of talk that makes you worry about a man’s safety. And I mean that as a compliment.

**He’s clear about China.** Vivek calls himself a George Washington American-firster, and he identifies the Chinese Communist Party as America’s foremost adversary without hedging. He’s clearly done serious study on Xi Jinping. He has a concrete strategy for deterring a CCP invasion of Taiwan. He understands geopolitics at the level of someone who can actually paint the big picture.

**His campaign slogan is TRUTH.** Not as a marketing gimmick but as a direct counter to postmodern relativism. He says—and actually practices—the idea that there is such a thing as objective truth, and that he will say it even when it costs him politically. Some of what he’s said that no American politician has dared say in recent memory:

- CRT is *psychological slavery*—worse than historical slavery because it tells Black children they are permanent victims by birth. He would abolish the Department of Education that mandates this poison.
- Americans who hate America should be offered a one-way exit with a cash incentive—a “Be My Guest” policy. I’d apply the same logic to South Korea’s pro-Pyongyang faction and every corruption-shielding leftist who’s been undermining the nation.
- Abortion is homicide. Homicide law is a state matter. *Roe v. Wade* should have been overturned long ago.
- Raise the voting age to 25. If you want to vote at 18, complete military service or pass the naturalisation civics exam.
- The explosion of violent crime is linked directly to the closure of psychiatric institutions—itself the product of big pharma lobbying. Say it louder.

**He has the charisma to back all of this up.** Like Obama—but unlike Obama, who was pure packaging over radical Marxist content—Vivek has a worldview underneath the magnetism. A real philosophy. And it’s one I can get behind.

I haven’t been this excited about a political figure in a long time.

**Update:** Vivek didn’t win the primary. But what happened next — [Trump and Courage](/courage/) — changed something in me.
