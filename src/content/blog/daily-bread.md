Growing up in Scotland, our family discovered [Robert Murray M’Cheyne’s Bible reading plan](/mccheyne) and followed it faithfully for years.

> “Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.”
> 
> Psalm 119:105

At Cambridge University, the Christian Union handed out booklets promoting the same plan. I embraced it eagerly, continuing to read the four daily passages year after year.

By God’s grace, this steady diet of Scripture—Old Testament once, New Testament and Psalms twice year after year—has kept my feet on the path through marriage, a PhD at Yale, raising children, and a demanding career in finance. The Word has been my anchor.

I’ve always loved technology too. Building [my first iOS app](/sunday)—a simple calendar clock—was gruelling but exhilarating. That experience opened the door to something deeper: the app I’d always wanted.

Most Bible apps today overwhelm. They pile on notifications, devotionals, social sharing, unfinished plans, and endless features. Wonderful for study or search, perhaps—but for daily, distraction-free reading? Not quite.

God bless the team behind YouVersion; their work has blessed millions. Yet I longed for something stripped back: just M’Cheyne’s four passages, clean NKJV text, high-quality audio, nothing else.

The need grew so strong I built [a basic web version first](/bible-app). Python and Streamlit made it quick. Every day it loaded the readings with optional text-to-speech. I used it faithfully.

But web limitations nagged: clunky scrolling, no premium TTS voices, no seamless passage navigation.

Now, in February 2026, the native iOS app is born: **Daily McCheyne – Word of God in a Year**.

For the past two weeks I’ve used it daily. Morning dog-walk: open app, press play, listen to four passages in crisp Enhanced TTS. Effortless. Nourishing. A quiet joy.

Will this become a movement? Will the Body of Christ fall in love with God’s Word again?

> “O come, you children, listen to me; I will teach you the fear of the Lᴏʀᴅ.”
> 
> Psalm 34:11

He is coming quickly (Revelation 22:12). Will we be found feeding on His Word when He appears?
