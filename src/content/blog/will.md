## The Time Is Now: Preparing for the Rapture

As we watch the ongoing developments involving Israel, Lebanon, and Iran, it becomes increasingly apparent that something significant may be on the horizon. There is a sense that the world is at a crucial turning point, and I cannot shake the feeling that the Rapture could occur soon. As believers, we must live with a unique balance—planning as though we have a hundred years ahead, yet ready to depart today if God so wills.

In the secular world, it is considered wise for anyone over fifty to prepare a will, a safeguard for any emergency. This preparation is seen as an act of responsibility, ensuring that everything is set in order in case of an unforeseen event. In the same way, Christians who live by and believe in the Bible must think about the legacy they leave behind. As the Church, it is time we take the lead in encouraging believers to make a “Rapture Will,” a document that outlines our intentions for what will be left behind when we are suddenly taken up. We should start considering simple but crucial things like, “Who will I leave this particular possession to?”, “Who will I ask to look after my pet dog?”, and “How will I communicate what has happened to those left behind?”

Once such a will is created, it can become a powerful evangelistic tool. Imagine sitting down with non-believing neighbours, friends, or relatives and giving this document to them. It is not merely a legal document but a testimony—that we take the Bible seriously. Through this, we present an opportunity for them to understand and prepare for what is coming, even if they currently reject the truth. The Rapture Will could serve as an urgent final plea for their souls, and also serve as a deterrent against the coming deception after the rapture (more on this below).

Yet, the tragic reality is that most churches today are hesitant or even unwilling to address eschatology—the study of the end times. They fear division within the congregation or consider the topic too controversial. In addition, many Protestant churches still allow themselves to be corrupted by Replacement Theology, which has dulled their anticipation of Christ’s imminent return. Instead of a blessed hope, the coming of Jesus has become a neglected doctrine. Ironically, it seems that Satan, along with Hollywood, is the only one preparing for a pre-tribulation rapture with any seriousness. If we look at many movies and TV shows being produced, there is a common theme—how to deceive the population by explaining away the Rapture when it happens.

One chilling example of this is the new Apple TV+ series, “Sugar”. Its storyline reflects a growing trend in entertainment: suggesting that Christians are like aliens among us, and their sudden disappearance is merely them “returning to where they came from.” This sort of narrative programming subtly primes people to accept any explanation other than the truth—that the Rapture is the fulfilment of God’s promise to His Church. The world will be told that those who vanished were not believers taken by Jesus, but some other fantastical explanation involving extraterrestrial aliens and UFOs will be given to lead people astray. It is deeply disturbing to see such deceptive narratives at work, preparing humanity to reject the true message of the Gospel even after the Church is gone.

Given this, we must remain vigilant in prayer and steadfast in our commitment to truth. We cannot be silent or complacent. The Rapture is not merely a doctrine for theological debate; it is a reality that could occur at any moment. Now is the time for the Church to rise up and proclaim this truth boldly, preparing both ourselves and those around us. A Rapture Will is just one practical way to demonstrate our faith in action, showing that we truly believe in what Scripture promises.

As we live in these uncertain times, let us hold fast to the blessed hope of Jesus Christ's imminent return. Let us prepare our hearts, our homes, and our loved ones, both in practical and spiritual ways. Time is short, and the harvest is ready. May we be found faithfully serving when our Lord comes, and may we use every opportunity—even our own preparations for departure—to testify of His saving grace.

The world may not understand what is coming, but we do. Let us act like it.
