I joined the day they announced. Within a week, seventy thousand people had done the same.

The establishment's response was immediate and predictable: *neo-Nazis*, they said. Death threats followed. The BBC cranked up its [well-worn narrative machine](/sober/). Labour panicked. The usual suspects ran the usual playbook.

Which tells you everything.

A political movement does not attract death threats and establishment hysteria because it is fringe. It attracts them because it is dangerous to the people who have been running this country into the ground. Restore Britain is dangerous to them - and that is precisely why I joined.

## Rupert Lowe Has Said What Nobody Else Will

Restore Britain's leader, Rupert Lowe, has been unusually frank. Here is some of what he has said - and what I wholeheartedly agree with.

On immigration:

> "Restore Britain will, without apology or fear, deport the third world orcs who break into our country, rape young women and then expect the British to tolerate their presence. There is finally a political party that will defend our home, our people, our shires."

And more precisely:

> "Every illegal migrant will be deported. No questions asked. The boats will stop. Legal migrants will be expected to work, contribute, speak our language and respect our way of life. If they don't do that, they'll be asked to leave. If they hate us, and wish to do us harm - they will leave. We support net negative immigration."

How's that controversial? It isn't. It is what the overwhelming majority of the British public already believes. The political class has simply decided those people don't deserve representation. Restore Britain disagrees.

On the economy and the size of the state:

> "The soaring cost of living is suffocating, but let's not pretend that this is some unstoppable phenomenon. This is caused by politicians, and it can be solved by politicians - just different politicians who have the [courage](/maga-hat/) to do what needs to be done, however unpopular that may be."

> "Above all else, we need to brutalise the size of the state. A public sector bonfire that is visible from space - that is what Restore Britain would do. We would deliver a Britain that lives within its means."

> "I think [the state is bad](/leftism-eng/). I think the individual is good. I trust the individual to make the decisions that are best for them and their family. I do not trust the bureaucrat to spend your money in the best possible way."

On the national debt - which is simply debt in our name, debt our children will inherit:

> "Billions and billions, just spent on interest. No household could live like that, so why can we allow the country to do so? We need to cut the debt, not just the deficit. That will be painful - really, really painful. There are no easy solutions. Don't like it? Don't vote Restore Britain. I'm not promising some utopia like the others. I'm telling the truth."

This is not radicalism. This is the position of virtually every productive adult in Britain who pays their taxes, raises their children, and watches the government waste their money on things that fill them with rage. Rupert is simply the first major political figure in years to say it plainly, without hedging, without triangulating, without one eye on the approval of the Guardian comment section.

## The Establishment's Panic Is the Point

The hysteria directed at Restore Britain - the neo-Nazi smear, the death threats issued against Rupert personally, the coordinated pressure from media and political establishment - is not accidental. This is how the British establishment destroys what it cannot absorb.

They did it to UKIP. They did it to the Brexit Party. They will attempt it here. But as Rupert says:

> "The establishment is throwing everything at Restore Britain, already. This is going to continue for years. They will get nasty, they will lash out. They already have. Let me tell you one thing - we are not going anywhere."

Nor should they be.

I want to be honest about the language Rupert uses. When I read the word "orcs," I did not flinch. I understood it. He is not speaking of people who have a different cultural preference, peacefully exercising it. He is speaking of men who crossed illegally into Britain, who committed rape, and who are now shielded from consequences by a political and legal establishment that cares more about its own pieties than about the girls who were violated. Rupert's language is blunt. It is supposed to be. He is speaking for the victims, not the perpetrators.

That is not extremism. That is [moral clarity](/empathy/).

## I Am Genuinely Worried About Rupert's Security

I will say this plainly: I am worried about Rupert Lowe's personal safety.

The combination of people who would like to see him silenced - within certain communities who regard his immigration position as an existential threat, within a hostile media establishment, within a Labour government that considers him a serious political danger - is not trivial. "Unfortunate accidents" happen in [politics](/courage/). History is not short of examples.

I genuinely wish Elon Musk would step in and fund round-the-clock, best-in-class personal security for Rupert. Not as a luxury - as a necessity. The man is offering Britain a democratic exit from a crisis that, if unresolved, will end in something far uglier than political defeat.

If the democratic route is closed - if Restore Britain is smeared into irrelevance, if its leadership is neutralised - I do not think Britain avoids a reckoning. What follows would make The Troubles in Northern Ireland look contained. A hundred times worse. That is not a prophecy I want to make. But it is one I believe.

Rupert Lowe is, right now, the thin red line between a democratic resolution and something none of us want to see. I pray for his protection.

## Why I Joined

I joined because I am a Christian, and a Christian's first loyalty is to truth. And the truth is that Britain is in serious trouble - not because of bad luck or global forces beyond our control, but because of deliberate political choices made by people who do not represent us and do not care about us.

I joined because I am a father. I want my sons to inherit a country that is still recognisably Britain - its freedoms, its character, its civilisational inheritance. The [multiculturalist](/multiculturalism/) project has not enriched us. It has weakened us, and some of us have paid for it with our daughters.

I joined because I believe every human being is made in the image of God, and that the metastasising bureaucratic state is an affront to that dignity. The state does not know better than you how to raise your children, spend your money, or live your life. It never has. It never will.

I joined because someone has to. And seventy thousand others felt the same, in one week.

Join us. [Restore Britain](https://restorebritain.org.uk).
