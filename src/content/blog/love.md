I’ve been meditating on the [coming](/end3) of Christ’s **Millennial Reign** for some time now. The thought of [reigning with Christ for a thousand years](/throne-of-david), overseeing a world finally made right, really excites me. I try to be as concrete as possible. For example: did you know that we will most likely not need sleep during the thousand years? Instead, our [resurrection bodies](/rapture) will enable us to teleport to Jerusalem each night, to debrief with our King and receive instructions for the following day—how awesome! It’s thrilling, but questions began to arise. **How will we as [Church Saints and Old Testament Saints](/two) communicate** across cultures, languages, and times? How will so many differences come together in unity?

These questions had been lingering in my heart when, at my father’s suggestion, I started reading **1 Corinthians 13** each morning. He’d been doing so for a month and said it had been life-transformative. At first, I wasn’t sure what to expect, but I trusted his words and began reading it meditatively in my morning prayers. As I let the words wash over me day after day, I began to see it—the answer to the questions I had about the Millennial Reign. It dawned on me with startling clarity: it will all work beautifully because **the Kingdom of Jesus will be a [Kingdom defined by love](/propitiation)**.

As the Holy Spirit fills us and empowers us, we will live out a transformative love that binds us together in unity. 1 Corinthians 13 describes love as something that “bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.” **This love transcends** our natural inclinations, uniting us across language barriers, cultural divides, and historical differences. **Love will cover all sins and shortcomings** that could divide us. In God’s Kingdom, love is the bridge that brings us together, and our differences, once divisive, will become a beauty and strength, held together in the bond of perfect love.

Reflecting on this fills me with **peace**. The beauty of the Millennial Reign isn’t in our ability to overcome every obstacle with strength, but in the perfect love that God pours into us. This love will conquer all divides and unite us as one body in Christ, learning to work together, communicate, and reign in harmony. The world will be transformed, not by force, but by the outpouring of love that covers all things.

It’s humbling to think of a Kingdom where love reigns supreme. It challenges my tendency to build walls and protect myself. In my flesh, I’m prone to division, pride, and selfishness. But in Christ’s Kingdom, **I will be perfected by His love**. We will stand as one family, united in our love for the Saviour who made it all possible.

So, I wait with expectation. I wait not in fear or confusion, but with the sure knowledge that when Christ returns, everything will be made right—not by our efforts, but by the Holy Spirit empowering us to live out His love. A love that will bind us together, fill the earth with His glory, and bring us into eternal fellowship with our King. What **[a blessed hope](/end3)** indeed! Maranatha!
