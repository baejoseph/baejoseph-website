Below is a short biographical summary of my spiritual journey as of 2024:

I was born the son of a Korean Presbyterian minister, firmly rooted in a very conservative Reformed tradition. My theological upbringing was steeped in Calvinism, marked by Sola Scriptura, Amillennial eschatology, and Replacement theology—views that I held tightly for much of my early life. To this day, I am grateful for this firm foundation of an emphasis on God’s Word above all. As I like to say, the Presbyterian system of theology is perhaps the best pedagogical foundation for any believer, _as long as they don’t remain there_. Interestingly, my father, despite his deeply conservative stance, remained open to the charismatic movement. He would even take my brother and I to pentecostal revival meetings so we can experience the supernatural workings of the Holy Spirit; I believe this really planted seeds for my future theological growth, and I am grateful to my dad.

During university, I joined [CICCU](https://ciccu.org.uk) and even attended a Presbyterian church that held a cessationist view, almost succumbing myself to the belief that the miraculous gifts of the Spirit had ceased. But God, in His grace, intervened. In my third year, at the Alpha Course Leaders’ conference at HTB London, I experienced the power of the Holy Spirit firsthand, receiving the gift of tongues. This moment was pivotal—it shattered my rigid, “Word-only” theology and opened the door for me to explore a more charismatic understanding of faith.

[My journey](/journey) led me deeper into Pentecostal and charismatic theology, where I began to see the shortcomings of cessationism and understood the Early and Latter Rain paradigm—the Early Rain outpouring of the Holy Spirit at the first Pentecost and the Latter Rain beginning at the turn of the 20th century, as seen in revivals like Azusa Street, the Welsh Revival, and Pyongyang. I came to recognise these as significant moves of God, restoring spiritual gifts to the church in preparation for the end times.

A significant influence in this season was Derek Prince. He taught me about the [baptism of the Holy Spirit](/allegiance), deliverance, [fasting](/fasting), and the importance of having a biblical view of Israel. His teachings helped me realize that God’s covenant promises to Israel still stand, reshaping my perspective away from Replacement Theology. I came to see the Biblical significance of the [May 1948 Establishment of the State of Israel](/end3) and came to see all the subsequent wars (even to this day) as fulfilment of the OT prophecy concerning Israel and the surrounding nations. How exciting!

Later, my theological journey brought me to believe in [pre-tribulation rapture](/rapture), a subset of [premillennial eschatology](/eschatology), largely influenced by figures like [Chuck Missler](https://koinoniainstitute.org) and [Arnold Fruchtenbaum](https://www.ariel.org). This new understanding brought a fresh hope, eagerly anticipating the imminent return of Christ and His [Millennial Kingdom](/throne-of-david).

Though I am still learning, I am profoundly grateful to God for His faithfulness through every twist and turn of my spiritual journey. From my Reformed upbringing to my charismatic awakening and to my current blessed hope, God has faithfully led me into a fuller understanding of His Word—a journey that continues as I seek to know Him more deeply each day.
