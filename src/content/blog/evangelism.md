In my journey with various methods of [street evangelism](/wooden-cross), including door-knocking, distributing gospel leaflets, and initiating conversations to share the Gospel, my conviction has always been that persuasion played a key role. My aim was always to present the message of Jesus Christ in an appealing way to encourage acceptance of Him as Lord and Saviour and to guide individuals in praying the sinner’s prayer. This has meant that despite being blessed with the gift of evangelism (I always feel excited to go out on street evangelism), I’ve often found myself hesitant due to fears of rejection and failure, feeling burdened by the responsibility to persuade.

However, a recent shift in my perspective on evangelism has profoundly changed my approach, bringing a sense of liberation. This transformation stemmed from two key insights:

Firstly, I recognised that my role as an evangelist isn’t to persuade but to clearly present the gospel. Paul, in Colossians 4:3-4, sought prayer not only for opportunities to preach the gospel but also that he might proclaim it clearly, as he ought. This shift in mindset relieved me from the pressure of persuasion, redirecting it to the Holy Spirit, whose role is to work within the hearts of listeners.

Secondly, I achieved clarity on the essence of the gospel message, succinctly captured in 1 Corinthians 15:3-4:

1.  Jesus Christ died for our sins, according to the Scriptures,
2.  He was buried,
3.  [He rose again on the third day](/bayes), according to the Scriptures.

This understanding simplified my mission. My task is to communicate these truths clearly and allow the listener to respond. Questions may arise, such as the nature of sin or the scriptural basis for Christ's life and mission, and I am prepared to address these if asked. However, my primary duty remains the clear proclamation of these facts.

Below is a typical interaction I might have during street evangelism:

    Me: “Excuse me, sir, I am here to share the Gospel. Are you familiar with the Good News?”
    Stranger: “No, I’m not.”
    Me: “Would you like to hear the Good News? It will only take a moment.”
    [Without waiting for a response, I continue.]
    Me: “The Gospel, or Good News, comprises three key facts: First, Jesus Christ died for your sins according to the Scriptures. Second, He was buried. Third, He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures. Sir, do you now understand the Gospel?” [At times, I ask them to repeat the points to ensure understanding.]
    Stranger: “Yes, I understand.”
    Me: “Excellent. I wish you a great day, sir.”
    [I then move on to the next individual.]

This method reflects the biblical model of evangelism. Jesus did not instruct us to persuade but to proclaim the gospel. He assured us that His sheep would hear His voice and respond. Faith arises from hearing God's Word. While we are accountable for sharing the Gospel, the responsibility for individual responses rests not on our persuasiveness but on the Holy Spirit’s movement in each heart.

Related to these insights, I want to address the concept of “lordship salvation,” which posits that salvation requires one to accept Jesus not only as Saviour but also as Lord. This is a common mistake that I used to believe as well, but now I realise it is not scriptural. The lordship salvation doctrine adds a condition beyond the simple faith in the Gospel message of Christ’s atoning death and resurrection as outlined in the Scriptures. Such an addition is contrary to the Biblical pattern such as in Ephesians 2:8-9, where salvation is clearly stated to be by grace through faith alone, not by some acknowledgment of His lordship over our lives as a precondition. Sure, accepting Jesus as our Lord must happen and it happens after salvation, but to introduce it as a precondition for salvation introduces unnecessary barriers to salvation and hinders effective evangelism.

In conclusion, this simple approach to evangelism frees the evangelist from the burden of persuasion, allowing him to instead trust in the Holy Spirit to work in listeners’ hearts. Our role is to [faithfully proclaim](/courage) the truths of Christ’s death, burial, and resurrection, and leave the spiritual awakening to God. This Biblical evangelism ensures our efforts are both joyful and fulfilling, grounded in obedience and reliant on divine grace.
