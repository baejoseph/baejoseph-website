**Reclaiming the Blessings of Biblical Tithing**

In today’s church teachings, the profound practice of tithing has often been overshadowed or neglected. Yet, tithing remains a vital principle that aligns believers with God’s revealed will, opening doors to spiritual and material blessings. This essay explores the significance of tithing to God and extends the concept to include tithing to our parents, emphasising how these practices enrich our lives and relationships.

**Tithing to God: Unlocking Divine Blessings**

The Bible presents tithing as an essential act of obedience and faithfulness. In Malachi 3:8-10, God issues a compelling challenge: “Will a man rob God? Yet you have robbed Me! But you say, ‘In what way have we robbed You?’ In tithes and offerings.” By withholding tithes, we are, in essence, stealing from God and depriving ourselves of His promised blessings. God continues, “Bring all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be food in My house, and try Me now in this… if I will not open for you the windows of heaven and pour out for you such blessing that there will not be room enough to receive it.” (NKJV)

This passage is not about enforcing legalism or instilling fear of sinning. Rather, it invites us to recognise divine principles and live our best lives in full alignment with God’s will. Tithing is an act of trust, an acknowledgment that “Everything we have has come from You, and we give You only what You first gave us!” (1 Chronicles 29:14, NLT). It is a tangible expression of our belief that everything we possess is a gift from God.

The Apostle Paul reinforces the attitude we should have toward giving in 2 Corinthians 9:7: “So let each one give as he purposes in his heart, not grudgingly or of necessity; for God loves a cheerful giver.” (NKJV) Generous and cheerful giving reflects a heart that is free from the idol of mammon. If we struggle to give even a tenth of our income, it may indicate that money holds an inappropriate place in our hearts. Jesus warned, “You cannot serve God and Mammon” (Matthew 6:24). Thus, tithing serves as a practical check on where our true priorities lie.

A common debate arises over whether tithing should be calculated from pre-tax or post-tax income. While this is a worthwhile discussion, it’s important not to judge our brothers and sisters in Christ over such matters. The focus should remain on the heart’s intention rather than legalistic calculations.

**Tithing to Parents: Honouring Those Who Gave Us Life**

Extending the principle of tithing to our parents is a natural progression rooted in gratitude and respect. Our parents are the vessels through whom God granted us life. They nurtured us, cared for us, and supported us through our formative years. Proverbs 23:22 advises, “Listen to your father who begot you, and do not despise your mother when she is old.” Tithing to our parents is a meaningful way to honour them and acknowledge their sacrifices.

Jesus Himself rebuked the Pharisees for neglecting this duty in favour of religious formalities. In Mark 7:11-13, He said, “But you say, ‘If a man says to his father or mother, “Whatever profit you might have received from me is Korban”’ (that is, a gift to God), then you no longer let him do anything for his father or his mother.” By declaring their resources as devoted to God (Korban), they avoided supporting their parents, thus violating God’s commandment to honour father and mother.

**Putting it into practice and the Blessings that Follow**

Practically speaking, upon receiving income, setting aside 10% for God (through the local church) and another 10% for our parents embodies a commitment to these foundational relationships. As responsible individuals who understand the meaning of gratitude, this practice acknowledges the debt of love and care we owe to our parents.

After marriage, this practice can be adapted to strengthen family bonds further. Dividing the 10% designated for parents equally between both sets of parents—and giving “across” (the husband seen to be giving to his in-laws and the wife to her in-laws)—can foster mutual respect and affection. Such acts of generosity have the potential to enrich marriages and cultivate enduring, positive relationships with in-laws. It may even serve as a remedy for marital strife, as honouring each other’s parents builds a foundation of mutual respect and love.

**Conclusion**

Reintroducing the practice of tithing to God and our parents is not about adhering to legalistic requirements but about expressing the priorities of our hearts in tangible ways. Money, often a sensitive and telling aspect of our lives, can be a powerful tool for demonstrating our trust in God and our appreciation for our parents. By embracing tithing, we align ourselves with divine principles, open ourselves to God’s abundant blessings, and nurture the relationships that form the bedrock of our lives.

Let us accept God’s invitation to “try Me now in this” (Malachi 3:10) and experience the fullness of His promises as we honour Him and those He has placed in our lives. By doing so, we not only enrich our own lives but also strengthen the fabric of our families and communities, living in full alignment with God’s revealed will.
