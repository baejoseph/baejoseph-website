Multiculturalism in the United Kingdom has been a cataclysmic failure, primarily because it abandoned the foundational Protestant Biblical Christian values that once defined British identity. This essay asserts that the multicultural endeavour could have thrived if it had been deeply rooted in the nation’s Christian heritage. Instead, by disregarding these core values, the UK failed to integrate new cultural influences into a strong, existing value system, resulting in severe fragmentation of national identity rather than enrichment. This misstep not only weakened societal cohesion but also diluted the moral and ethical standards that were key to Britain's historical success.

Multiculturalism in the United Kingdom was initially pitched as a means to foster inclusiveness and celebrate diversity, aiming to enrich British society by encouraging different cultures to maintain their unique identities while contributing to national unity. However, the reality has been markedly different. The policies fell disastrously short because they lacked grounding in the nation’s foundational Christian values. Instead of weaving a tapestry of diverse threads into a cohesive national fabric, these policies allowed cultural silos to form, leading to a fragmented society and rising crime rates. This division has not enriched the UK but has rather eroded the shared sense of British identity, replacing unity with conflict and undermining the very goals multiculturalism aimed to achieve.

The catastrophic failure of multiculturalism in the UK can be directly traced to the systematic dismantling of the country’s core identity. Historically, British identity was deeply rooted in Protestant Biblical Christianity, which provided not only a moral and ethical framework but also shaped the societal norms and legal structures of the nation. Yet, those in positions of academic and political power who championed multiculturalism were intent on eradicating these conservative Christian values, such as the sanctity of family and the moral principles derived from the Bible. This deliberate push to strip away the UK's Christian heritage has not only led to a loss of British identity but has fundamentally compromised the nation’s ability to integrate diverse cultures into a cohesive society.

The argument that emphasising Christian values in multicultural policies might alienate non-Christian communities, promoting secularism and pluralism as more inclusive alternatives, is deeply flawed. In reality, the purported neutrality of secularism often devolves into a rigid, oppressive ideology where science and rationalism are worshipped, enforced by a priest class of mainstream media and cultural elites that harshly penalises any deviation from its narrow dogma. In stark contrast, Christian values provide a stable moral framework that transcends religious boundaries, fostering virtues like charity, honesty, and community, and supporting societal well-being without demanding conformity. This makes a Christian foundation not only more inclusive but also more conducive to a harmonious society than the coercive uniformity of secular orthodoxy.

In the vacuum left by the erosion of traditional Christian convictions, two dominant forces have emerged, each deeply antithetical to the values upon which Britain was built.

-   First, the totalitarian materialistic nihilism of atheism masquerades as rational and enlightened thought, yet imposes a rigid, unyielding dogma that stifles true intellectual and cultural diversity. In today’s Britain, any kind of Wrongspeak when it comes to the Climate Cult, the Cult of All Sexual Perversions, and the Worshipful Pursuit of Equity are severely punishable by firing, ostracisation, cancellation, and legal persecution by the priest class. Over 70% of employees in the UK do not feel to speak their minds at the workplace for fear of repercussions. There have been an order of magnitude more arrests in the UK than in Russia for what people posted online; this is no longer the Britain that the World War II veterans gave their lives for.
-   Second, there is the rise of militant Islamism, marked not only by the pursuit of Sharia law but also by a history of terrorist activities that threaten the very fabric of Western society. In my last 18 months of leading Bible studies for ex-Muslim asylum seekers in the UK, I’ve encountered victims of some horrific stories in Sharia-enforced nations such as Iran and Syria. A “religion” that teaches and enforces death penalty for its former adherents is not a religion; it is an illegal cult mob. Contrary to the often-repeated lie that Islam is a religion of peace, its doctrines and practices frequently stand in sharp opposition to the foundational Christian principles of liberty, justice, and compassion that have shaped British values. This stark contrast underscores the peril of abandoning a unifying and morally robust Christian heritage in favour of ideologies that neither respect nor promote the genuine pluralism necessary for a peaceful and cohesive society.

But it didn’t have to be this way. As a second-generation Korean Christian immigrant, my family’s experience stands as a testament to successful cultural integration that respects personal heritage. We have seamlessly woven our Korean customs and traditions, such as celebrating Chuseok and wearing hanbok, with the foundational British values rooted in Biblical Christianity. This integration has allowed us to thrive within the UK without sacrificing our cultural identity. Embracing the Judeo-Christian values central to British society, such as the importance of family and community responsibility, has not only facilitated our inclusion but has enriched the cultural fabric of our local community. This harmonious blending demonstrates that true multiculturalism succeeds when new cultures integrate with, rather than isolate from, the core values of the host nation.

In conclusion, the success of a multicultural society hinges on an unapologetic commitment to its foundational values. Britain’s failed multicultural experiment underscores the critical need for a nation to maintain and reinforce its core principles—principally those rooted in Biblical Christianity—to ensure the harmonious integration of diverse cultures. Only by clearly defining and upholding these values can Britain, or any nation, hope to cultivate a truly cohesive national identity that not only embraces diversity but strengthens the collective fabric of society. To make Britain Great again, we need to make Britain Christian again. W need to make Britain pray again. This commitment is not merely beneficial but essential for the survival and prosperity of the nation’s cultural legacy and societal unity.
