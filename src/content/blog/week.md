My Weekly Schedule as of June 2025

I really feel I found the right balance and rhythm for both bodily and spiritual health.

> “For bodily exercise profits a little, but godliness is profitable for all things, having promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come.”
> 
> 1 Timothy 4:8
> “Now godliness with contentment is great gain.”
> 
> 1 Timothy 6:6

Thank You God!
