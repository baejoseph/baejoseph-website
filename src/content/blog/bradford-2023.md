Since end of 2022, I’ve been serving [Compassion2All](https://www.compassion2all.org/team-1), a UK-based charity, as a Lead Bible Teacher. This means I lead a small group Bible study every Tuesday over zoom: about 5-15 Christian brothers and sisters (who are mostly refugees and asylum seekers in the UK) attend every week, and I’ve gotten to know some of them really well.

May this year, it was finally time to visit them in person and to fellowship with them. What a blessed time! Joshua accompanied, and was able to see first hand what his dad was up to every Tuesday evening.
