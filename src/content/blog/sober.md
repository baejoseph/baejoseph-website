#### Detoxing the Church from the Poison of Mainstream Media

In November 2025, the BBC’s grotesque manipulation of President Trump’s January 6 speech—deliberately edited to inflame and deceive ahead of the 2024 US presidential election—has finally torn the mask off an institution that has long pretended to neutrality. Selective cuts, fabricated context, brazen lies—then the inevitable performance of wounded innocence. They are not sorry for the deception; they are sorry they were exposed. This is not a mishap. It is the ripe fruit of decades of ideological capture that now infects schools, universities, and—most tragically—far too many pulpits and elder boards.

Can we honestly deny the damage already done? Vast swathes of the Body of Christ have had their worldview quietly rewritten by the relentless drip of left-leaning propaganda masquerading as “news.” More believers have been formed by the BBC evening bulletin than by the Bible read in context. The result is the needless tearing apart of congregations over BLM, LGBTQ ideology, lockdown authoritarianism, and the Covid injections—issues where Scripture speaks plainly, yet leaders parroted the approved narrative instead of the Spirit’s voice. Churches did not split because the Word was ambiguous; they split because half the leadership room was still spiritually intoxicated by the mainstream media.

Paul never hesitated to raise the bar for those who would shepherd God’s flock. Among the qualifications in 1 Timothy 3 and Titus 1 we find the command that an elder must be “**sober-minded**” (1 Timothy 3:2)—nēphalios, vigilant, clear-headed, free from every form of intoxication, whether literal wine or the subtler stupor of this age’s lying spirit.

In 2025, therefore, I propose—humbly yet urgently—that every Bible-believing church make the following an explicit, non-negotiable leadership requirement:

**No one may serve as elder, deacon, pastor, or in any position of spiritual oversight while still relying on the mainstream secular media (BBC, ITV, Sky, The Guardian, CNN, The New York Times, etc.) as their primary source of news and worldview formation.**

This is not a political litmus test. It is a discernment test. If, after the naked deception of the last five years—coordinated fear, censored truth, weaponised “fact-checks”—a professed mature believer still looks to these outlets as trustworthy, can we honestly say they are “sober-minded”? Can they guard the flock when they themselves remain captive to the spirit of the age?

We desperately need leaders like [the sons of Issachar](/heroics), men “who had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do” (1 Chronicles 12:32, NKJV). They saw clearly. They knew what must be done. That is the minimum standard now required.

The church is not called to referee internal culture wars while the house burns. We are soldiers in a fierce spiritual conflict (Ephesians 6:12). The Commander is returning—suddenly, surely, soon. “Behold, I am coming quickly!” He declares three times in Revelation 22:7, 12, 20 (NKJV).

Let us no longer place watchmen on the walls who are still drunk on Babylon’s wine.

Let us appoint only those whose minds are renewed, whose eyes are open, whose ears hear what the Spirit is saying to the churches in these last days.

The hour is late. Maranatha. Come, Lord Jesus!
